{
  "Alert": "This skill counters all stealth Skills, such as Vanish, Fade In A Crowd, Whisper Walk or Cover of Night, as well as any other effects that actively hide a single character. In order for Alert to work, the target has to be in your line of sight (that means that if they’re hiding behind a tree or you can only hear them, you’re out of luck). You then need to spend 5 Mind Points, point toward the other person using a stealth Skill and say “Alert”. When using the skill Alert, the stealth effect that the targeted player was using immediately drops. This skill means that your character has sharp senses and/or superior training. Using it should not be seen as “meta-gaming” in any way. If your character is targeted with Alert and was using a stealth Skill, then you can’t use another stealth Skill for at least 1 minute after Alert was used. (This does not apply to targets using Flight or Burrowing as a means of disappearing.)",
  "Analyze Compound": "This Skill counters Disguise Contents. In order to use this skill, spend 1 Mind Point and then declare “Analyze Compound” while examining a substance (like a Brew or a Meal). This automatically gives you details about the single unknown brewed substance. Usually, this means that you get to read the attached Item Card, though certain rare or plot-specific brews may require speaking to game staff at Logistics. You can also use Analyze Compound to uncover ‘spiked’ food or drink. In certain plot-specific situations, you might also be able to use this Skill to get more details after spending more time roleplaying an intensive examination of a compound; these situations will be announced by storytelling staff when available.",
  "Analyze Creature": "This Skill is countered by Disguise. In order to use the Skill, spend 1 Mind Point and say “Analyze Creature, what are you?” The character (whether a NPC or a PC), will then tell you relevant details per Mind Point that you spend. To activate this Skill you must actively role play analyzing a target; this may include measuring the creature’s limbs, roleplaying dissecting the creature, and other actions for a minimum of 30 seconds minute before Skill use. At bare minimum, a player must be within 10 steps of a target, observing the target without using any other Skills or engaging in combat, before using the Analyze Creature Skill. You cannot simply point at a creature located across a field and learn about it. Analyze Creature reveals only creature name, creature type, overall threat level - 1, 2, or 3 - with 3 assumed for sentient beings and any vulnerabilities. In certain plot-specific situations, this Skill may also provide more details; such opportunities will be announced by storytelling staff when available.",
  "Animal Handler": "We all need to eat, right? Raising animals for food and supplies is an important part of survival. If you have Animal Handler, during the Check In process you can receive one of the following Named Herbs/Scraps for each level of the skill you possess (player’s choice): Milk, Beef, Eggs, Chicken, Lamb, or Wool. This Skill may be purchased up to 5 times; each new purchase requires a teacher who has more levels of the Skill than you currently possess. This Skill may only be used by a character at their home game.",
  "Attach": "This Skill is countered by Bomb Awareness. This Skill allows a character to mount and prime an existing Trap to go off when triggered. By spending 5 Mind Points and 5 Minutes per Crafts Level of the Trap, the trapper may install the Trap in an appropriate location and trigger as specified on the Trap card. When a Trap is placed, you must use a length of black thread to mark the trigger of the Trap, with the Trap card attached to at least one portion of the string. {li} Container Trap: String hung inside of lid {li} Door Trap: String running from door to door frame {li} Trip Line: String running from anchor object to anchor object (non door/container) {li} Pressure Plate: String outlining trigger area. Breaking, touching, pulling on, or stepping within the bounds of an outlined trigger results in the Trap activating. Trap triggers should never be strung above chest level for safety reasons. Physical representation of the trap is not required, but strongly encouraged. {p} This Skill can also be used to disarm visible traps. By spending 2 Mind Points and 10 Minutes per Crafts Level of the Trap, the trapper may remove the Trap without triggering it. Note that the Trap is destroyed by this process, and cannot be re-used. This Skill cannot remove applied poisons. {p} Attaching or disarming a trap requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the trapper is forced away from target location, uses combat Skills, or takes any damage. If interrupted, the Trap is not expended or triggered, but all Mind Points invested are lost. The time to disarm or attach a trap can be reduced by spending an additional 2 Mind Points to reduce the required time by 5 Minutes per expenditure. The minimum time to attach or disarm a Trap is 1 Minute.",
  "Avoid": "This Skill counters Concentrated Fire, Destroy Shield, Destroy Weapon, Disarming Shot, Scatter Shot, Sniped Shot, Knockout, and any other successful, ranged targeted attacks. In order to use this skill, spend 5 Mind Points and clearly say “Avoid!” This skill is ineffective against Area of Effect attacks (such as bombs or “By My Voice” effects), as they do not target the user individually.",
  "Backstab": "Sometimes you just need to get past that armor. By spending 5 Mind Points, you can say “Backstab, X Body!” and strike an enemy in the back torso area with a Small melee weapon. This causes the strike to slip past all armor and deal damage to the person’s body directly. Damage from backstab strikes may not be prevented, reduced by, or applied to armor of any kind, even if that armor would normally protect against such damage.",
  "Balance": "This Skill counters Knockdown and Take Down. By spending 5 Mind Points, you can call “Balance” and ignore one use of either Knockdown or Take Down. In addition, in situations such as walking across narrow paths, this Skill allows the user to receive one foot additional width on either side to represent their great sense of balance. Balance costs 1 Mind Point per use, and lasts for 10 paces or 1 minute, whichever comes first.",
  "Bartender's Tongue": "What’s the word? This Skill allows a player to come into game with additional knowledge, including rumors and other inside information about what’s been happening around town. To use this Skill, during Check In register that you have Bartender’s Tongue and you will be allowed to read a special list. This list will not be accessible later on during the event, so make sure that you memorize all the scuttlebutt that you think is important! This Skill may only be used by a character at their home game.",
  "Barricade": "This Skill is countered by Force Barricade. While anyone can guard a doorway, it’s the truly desperate that will try to block one. It takes a certain degree of thought and effort to be able to barricade a door in a way that makes it defensible as well as extremely difficult to pass through. For every 2 Mind Points and 2 minutes that you spend roleplaying its creation, an in-game Barricade may be created. This Barricade will have a Crafts Level equal to every two points invested in its creation. For example: If you spend 4 minutes and 4 Mind Points, you’ll wind up with a Barricade with a Crafts Level of 2. It’s important to note that a doorway should never actually be obstructed (we’d like to avoid personal injuries, and there are fire safety reasons). Also note that attacking players should never attempt to kick open or otherwise forcefully attempt entry. Instead, this Skill allows the user to affix a standard size index card to the outside of the door listing the Barricade’s Crafts Level. If players wish to add levels to the Barricade, they must repeat the crafting process to add Crafts Levels. You may attempt to add to a Barricade while it is under attack, though it should be noted it is a lot faster to tear one down than build one up. {p} Anyone looking to breach a Barricade must make loud knocking sounds, banging on the door with their weapons a total of 10 times, counting to 3 between each ‘assault.’ Each time this cycle is completed, the Crafts Level of the Barricade is lowered by 1. When the Crafts Level reaches zero, the Barricade is destroyed or “breached.” Once a Barricade has been breached, the doorway is open and cannot have a Barricade built on it for 10 minutes.",
  "Beg For Life": "This Skill counters Killing Blows, but is countered by Refuse. If under the effects of Choking Blow, you cannot use this skill. Sometimes, all you can do is plead. This Skill allows a player to beg for their life and not receive immediate Killing Blows. Each declaration of “Beg For Life” costs 1 Mind Point, and prevents any Killing Blows from being called for either 2 minutes or until the user of Beg For Life takes any action other than groveling for their very existence. Beg For Life is an area effect, and not targeted at a single individual. Beg For Life is different from most other Skills in that it can be used during Bleed Out as well as before Bleed Out.",
  "Big Dig": "Some people specialize in making money, some people specialize in growing things. Someone with Big Dig specializes in finding... stuff (we’re being nice by not calling it “junk”). This skill is most often used at Check In to receive random ‘stuff’ - the ‘artifacts’ pulled up by Big Dig are completely randomized. Typically, it will be little more than Basic Scrap, Basic Herb, or a local currency. Rarely, it may even be a dud. But there’s always a chance that you might actually find a real artifact of some kind, a useful trade good, or even special plot items. In certain plot specific instances, this Skill may also be used during an event to represent archaeological prowess; these opportunities will be announced by the storytelling staff. This Skill may be purchased up to 5 times, allowing for increased skill at finding things. Learning additional levels requires a teacher who has more levels of the Skill than you currently possess. {p} When checking in at Logistics the staff has a listing of 5 different difficulties of Big Dig locations. The largest Big Dig locations have the largest threats, but also provide the greatest reward. A player may start at any level of Big Dig that they would like, up to the cap of their Big Dig score (a character with 4 levels of Big Dig may start at a level 1,2,3, or 4 difficulty but NOT level 5). The player gets one roll per level of Big Dig that they have on their sheet, and they may LOWER the level they are doing their rolls at in between results. Taking the same example of a player with 4 ranks of Big Dig, if they started at rank 4 and received a large volume of damage from a Big Dig gone bad, they may in turn choose to go to a lower difficulty level for their next 3 Big Dig pulls. Big Dig is capable of killing character at rank 3 and above, so players are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to cut ties and go to easier levels if their Big Dig is starting to go poorly. This Skill may only be used by a character at their home game.",
  "Black Market Connections": "There are those who slide under the law — who rest in the underbelly of a settlement. A person with this Skill has connections with the Black Market and may discreetly contact with them without fear of repercussions, as well as utilize their many services. Black Market Connections may fence hot items for you, launder money, sell certain forbidden goods or even connect you with people who need... “work” done. This Skill costs no Mind Points, and usually requires talking to storytelling Staff Members at Logistics. For the purpose of check in usage, this Skill may only be used by a character at their home game. If a character with Black Market Connections finds out, in character, where a Black Market meeting is in character when they are traveling to another game, nothing prevents them from attending the meeting.",
  "Bless Weapon": "This Skill allows a player to Bless a melee, brawling, ranged, or firearm weapon so that it gains the “Blessed” trait for the duration of one day (until midnight). In order to use this skill, place a hand on the chosen weapon and call “Bless Weapon” while spending 5 Mind Points. Certain religious items may require Bless Weapon to operate, as well as successful performance of particular religious rituals. Blessed weapons may inflict additional damage and/or bypass damage reduction with regards to some enemies, especially the undead. For clarity, add “Blessed (Faith)” to the damage called with affected weapons; for example, if a sword that inflicts 5 damage and is Blessed by the Final Knights, the damage call would be “5 Blessed Knights!” each time it hits. Bless Weapon is not primarily used as a damage augmentation tactic, but instead a means to imbue faith into objects that require it for operation.",
  "Blind Fighting": "This Skill counters Blinding as well as Gizmos and situational effects that would make you blind. Sometimes, it pays to practice fighting with closed eyes. This Skill allows you to continue to attack and defend with all forms of brawling, melee, bolt action, and bow attacks--despite having blinded effects. In order to use this Skill, say “Blind Fighting” and spend 1 Mind Point. This cancels 1 use of the Blinding skill. If you’re using Blind Fighting, you may still use Parry, Avoid, Refuse, Mind Resistance, or Bounce; you may not use Skill augmented attacks, escape, stealth skills, thrown weapons, javelins, thrown Gizmos, or psionics until the Blinding effect ends.",
  "Blinding": "This Skill is defended against partially with Blind Fighting. This Skill can also be countered by Parry if the blow is dealt from the front. Fighting fair only gets you so far, and this Skill proves it. By spending 5 Mind Points and making a successful melee or ranged attack to the torso area, you may call “Blinding” and blind your opponent. This deals zero damage, but causes your target to use no Skills (other than Blind Fighting) and prevents them from running, walking away, attacking, blocking or avoiding strikes for 10 seconds.",
  "Bolt Action": "This Skill allows you to wield a single firearm. Using this Skill costs zero Mind Points; however, it requires a prop firearm to be present in one hand while packets are thrown from the other. Alternately, an approved weapon may fire contact safe toy darts instead of using thrown packets. As mechanical options change for foam dart toy weapons, the staff of Dystopia Rising needs to adjust what is and is not approved for regular use with a regularity that requires live updates instead of printed changes. With this in mind, please check the Dystopia Rising LARP network standards for what single action foam dart Physical Representations are approved for play. All dart guns must be approved on a branch by branch basis, the same as melee weapons, for safety. Players entering game with a firearm may only begin with a total of twenty contact safe toy firearm darts, but no limit to the number of packets that they have. Ammo fired may not be picked up in combat, but may be retrieved when the dust has settled. This represents how more ammo is quickly repacked. As ammo is lost and unable to be recovered, so is a portion of the total ammo a firearms user has available. Standard firearms do a base 3 Damage before improvements. {p} All weapon props must be approved before entering game; see the Logistics section for more details. A list of approved toy firearms can be found at the Dystopia Rising website. Some rules of thumb apply: it must be single shot or bolt action (no automatic firing weapons); it must fire soft, toy ammunition that does not require eye protection; and while decorating weapons is encouraged, it should always retain a clearly visible bright orange safety tip.",
  "Bomb Awareness": "This Skill counters Attach (to an extent). In order to use this skill, spend 5 Mind Points and say “Bomb Awareness.” This allows you to take back an action that triggered a trap. This Skill must be used IMMEDIATELY after the action was taken. Bomb Awareness does not grant knowledge of how to disarm the trap, where it is located or even the exact nature of the trap. However, the Skill allows you to have a type of sixth sense that a trap is present, as well as the fact that you should avoid that specific triggering action.",
  "Bounce": "This Skill counters ranged attacks that successfully target a shield or weapon. This includes Concentrated Fire, Destroy Shield, Destroy Weapon, Sniped Shot and Scatter Shot — assuming the packets or darts hit the shield or weapon. In order to use this Skill, say “Bounce!” and spend 1 Mind Point in order to deflect a single firearms, thrown weapon, or bow attack by using a shield or melee weapon, negating its effects. This attack must have struck the shield or the weapon instead of the player itself and costs 1 Mind Point per deflected shot. Bounce may only deflect damage equal to or less than three times the Crafts Level of the shield or weapon. For example, a Crafts 1 shield can Bounce a 3 damage shot, while a Crafts 10 shield can bounce a 30 point shot.",
  "Bow": "This Skill costs no Mind Points to use, and allows you to wield a simple bow and arrow. Bows allow you to use ranged combat skills available to both firearms and thrown weapons. For example, a character with a bow could use Nail, which is normally performed with thrown weapons, as well as Concentrated Fire, which normally employs firearms. Standard bows do a base 2 Damage before improvements and are represented with an approved contact safe bow and packets. Each thrown packet requires your throwing hand to touch the bow and then ‘draw’ the packet before firing. Real bows, that are capable of firing real arrows are not allowed at Dystopia Rising. Fake bows, that are not capable of firing real arrows, are allowed.",
  "Brawling": "Sometimes you just need to punch something. This Skill allows you to carry two small size melee boffers to represent fists. These boffers must be colored white to differentiate them from regular weapons. Damage is still taken when blocking incoming strikes, as they are part of the body. However, use of two brawling boffers does not require the Florentine skill, and they cannot be disarmed or broken like normal weapons (though the arm can still be Mangled). Brawling may be used off hand of a melee or bolt action weapon, with a brawling beater being wielded in the off hand. Effects such as ‘Iron Fists’ require a brawling physical representation to be in a characters hand to benefit from the bonuses of Knucks or brawling Skill augments. Brawling strikes do a base 1 damage each. Brawling can be augmented with items such as brass knuckles, usually just called “Knucks,” which are represented by certain colored tape. Unless otherwise stated on the crafting print, Knucks do not block incoming damage. Only Iron Fists allows an individual to block using their Brawling Skill without taking damage.",
  "Break Armor": "This Skill can be countered by Parry if the strike is from the front. All armor has weak spots, and you know how to exploit them. By declaring “Break Armor” and making a successful melee attack, you can render a target’s armor useless until it is repaired. This attack costs 10 Mind Points, inflicts zero damage, and must strike the armor itself.",
  "Break Shield": "This Skill can be countered by Parry. With a single successful melee attack that strikes a shield, you can declare “Break Shield!” and render a shield useless until it is repaired. This attack costs 5 Mind Points, inflicts zero damage, and must strike the target shield to work.",
  "Break Weapon": "This Skill can be countered by Parry, as long as the strike is from the front. With a single melee attack, you can declare “Break Weapon!” and render a single melee weapon, bolt action weapon, or bow useless until it is repaired. Natural weapons such as brawling boffers are unaffected by Break Weapon. Brawling augmenting Gizmos, such as Knucks, are not effected by Break Weapon if they are being wielded. However, Break Weapon may be used on Brawling augmented Gizmos if they are not currently being held (easier to hit a piece of metal on a table than a thin strip on a moving hand). This attack costs 5 Mind Points, inflicts zero damage, and must strike the target weapon to work. When using Break Weapon on a firearm, you must strike the arm holding the firearm instead of the gun (since most firearms are not boffer-safe props).",
  "Brew Master": "This Skill allows a character to get even more potency out of their Brews. During the Brewing process the Brew Master may spend an additional 2 Mind Points, 1 Rare Herb, and 10 Minutes of time roleplaying brewing at a Still, up to 5 times for a maximum of 10 Mind, 5 Rare Herb, and 50 Minutes. For each use of Brew Master, the resulting Brew’s Craft’s Level is increased by 1, and the Brew Master may choose to either increase the Brew’s Numerical Effect by 1 or extend its effect’s duration by 5 Minutes so long as the duration does not exceed 1 Hour. Note that in the case of brews with multiple numerical effects (restoring 5 Mind and 5 Body, for example), that all numerical effects are increased by 1. Many Brewing Recipes require Brew Master to unlock their full potential. {p} During the process of production a player may only use one item to manipulate crafting times or production results, unless the used items specifically state that they stack with other items. {p} Unless a piece of equipment, Gizmo, or mechanical device states otherwise a Brew may not be improved with Brew Master beyond crafts level 6. This is important to remember for brews that start at Crafts Levels higher than 1, as well as brews that allow for additional doses to be created with higher crafts levels.",
  "Brewing": "This Skill allows a character to distill powerful liquids from Herbs that have a variety of unique effects. By spending 2 Mind Points and 20 Minutes at a Still roleplaying brewing, the crafter may take the required Herb cards to Logistics to be traded in for a new Item Card. All brews start at Crafts Level 1 unless otherwise specified and have an expiration of 1 year. Crafting requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the crafter leaves the area within 5 feet of the Still, utilizes any combat Skills, or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points spent and materials invested are lost. Some abilities or items may reduce the time requirement for Brewing. The minimum time for Brewing, without the assistance of an Able Helper, is 5 minutes. {p} All brews, once produced, require an appropriately sized physical representation to be used (as near a volume as possible). Brews can be administered one of four ways. Applied to target, Inhaled by target, Ingested by target, or Injected into target. Applied Brews may only be applied to an appropriate target, such as an item, person, or weapon. Applied brews that require a weapon strike do not affect armored health. Injectable brews may be self-administered during Bleed Out. Injected and ingested brews may not be administered to an unwilling target that is not Bound, Knocked Out, or in Bleed Out. Note that this does not prevent an unaware target from consuming a brew themselves. {p} During the process of production a player may only use one item to manipulate crafting times or production results unless the used items specifically state that they stack with other items. {p} The following table lists recipes automatically known by everyone with this Skill. Note that other recipes may be discovered in game with their own Mind, Skill, and Resource requirements to produce. Non-standard recipes must present while roleplaying Brewing, and presented to Logistics when getting the new item issued. {table:4} Name and Volume ||| Stats ||| Required Resources ||| Value ||| Generic Brew, 36 oz  ||| No game mechanics, but can be sold for in game currency (teas, juices, etc).

  "Building Tomorrow": "This Skill allows a character to take Scrap and build new items. By spending 3 Mind Points and 30 Minutes at a Workbench roleplaying the fabrication, the crafter may take the required Scrap cards to Logistics to be traded in for a new Item Card. All items start at Crafts Level 1 and have a five year expiration date unless otherwise specified. While roleplaying making the item, you must make a significant amount of noise (there is no “quiet” crafting!). Crafting requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the crafter leaves the area within 5 feet of the Workbench, utilizes any combat Skills, or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points and materials invested are lost. Some abilities or items may reduce the time requirement for Building Tomorrow. The minimum time, without the assistance of an Able Helper, is 10 minutes. {p} During the process of production a player may only use one item to manipulate crafting times or production results unless the used items specifically state that they stack with other items. {p} The following table lists blueprints automatically known by everyone with this Skill. Note that other blueprints may be discovered in-game with their own Mind, Skill, and Resource requirements to produce.

  "Call The Almighty": "Sometimes all it takes is a little faith to get by. By calling upon divine intervention, you momentarily become a conduit for your deity, capable of miraculous healing powers. By spending 10 Mind Points and verbally calling on their deity to intercede, you can completely heal a wounded (but not dead) target other than yourself. The target (another target) is brought back up to their maximum Health Points and all mangled or severed limbs are repaired. However, derangements and poison/disease effects are not removed, and certain long-term “signature” physical injuries that are part of a character’s costuming or back story may remain at the discretion of the staff or the affected player. A player may use this Skill only 2 times per Twelves, and at least 30 minutes of active prayer to that character’s particular ‘Almighty’ are required within 2 hours after each use. This is an impressive capability, but one that carries a high cost in devotion as well: if the user ever fails to pray for the required amount of time, or acts against their god’s will, this power may cause up to 100 body damage to the user of the Skill, or if prayer regularly ignored, the Skill be permanently removed from that player’s sheet. A player who has been affected by Choking Blow, or similar Choking Blow affects from equipment, may not use Call the All Mighty.",
  "Carry": "This Skill allows you to lift and carry large weights for short periods of time. You cannot use this Skill while under the effects of a Mangled Leg and must have at least one functional Arm. For every 1 Mind Point, the character’s strength is increased by 1, for up to 20 paces or 5 minutes, whichever is shorter. To use this Skill, you must call “Carry X!” with “X” being the total Mind Points spent plus 1 (all characters are assumed to have a base strength of 1). So long as you have strength equal to an object’s Carry Rating, you may move at a walking pace. If you have strength greater than the object’s Carry Rating, you may move at full speed. You cannot normally Carry more than two objects, regardless of your strength. To represent carrying a person, gently grip your target’s hand after calling the effect and then walk your paces. All characters have a Carry Rating of 1, unless otherwise specified. Carry may only be used on willing targets or targets that are Knocked Out, Bound, or in Bleed Out.",
  "Challenge": "This Skill can be countered by Refuse or Choking Blow, assuming Choking Blow is used first. Knowing how to get someone’s blood up can be useful in a fight. By pointing out a single target, spending 5 Mind Points, and obviously challenging them to combat, you can cause your target to only attack you if it wants to fight. (As an example for challenging a Yorker, you can say: “Hey, Rust monkey! I hear you snuggle with Bay Walkers! Challenge!”) You will become the sole focus of that target’s ire; however, the effect of this Skill ends if the target is attacked by others, leaving it free to attack as it sees fit (or stop fighting altogether). Note that Challenge does not compel a target to start fighting, only ensures that if they do, they must attack only you. Challenge is not and cannot be subtle in any way, shape, or form, and as such is seen as obviously picking a fight by onlookers. If the user of Challenge runs away from the fight, is no longer visible or otherwise cannot be reached by the target, this Skill’s effects end.",
  "Charge": "This Skill can be countered by Parry if you strike the person from the front. Rushing into battle isn’t always a bad thing. By declaring “Charge!” and expending 5 Mind Points, your first strike against a new target has its damage doubled. Charge may only be used the first time engaging a target in a combat, and requires the user to have both feet firmly planted before striking for this ‘charged’ attack. Charge cannot be combined with Backstab, Murder, or Frightening Force; however it may be combined with other Skills. Do not actually strike a target harder when using the ‘charge’ Skill.",
  "Charisma": "This Skill can be countered by Refuse or Choking Blow, assuming Choking Blow is used first. Well, aren’t you charismatic? In order to use this Skill, you need to talk to your chosen target for at least 5 minutes. After that time, you can spend 1 Mind Point and then declare “Charisma.” This causes your target to become temporarily enthralled. While this will not cause a target to do self- destructive things, give away items or go against deeply held personal beliefs, it will cause them to treat the user as their best friend for 10 minutes. Treating the person under the effects of Charisma poorly, or outright attacking them, ends the effects. This is not actual mind control, simply the force of the Charisma user’s personality. For their part, the target of Charisma should try to interpret the user’s actions and words in the most favorable way possible, avoid harming them in any way, and generally treat them well. After all, what wouldn’t you do for your best friend?",
  "Chase": "This Skill counters Escape and Rescue. You won’t get away that easily! This Skill allows you to declare “Chase, Escape/Rescue Negated!” to block a single target’s use of the Escape or Rescue Skill once for 5 Mind Points. When this Skill is used successfully, neither you nor the fleeing character move anywhere and the scene continues. It is obvious that the fleeing survivor tried to run, but had its path of escape denied by the user of Chase. Use of this Skill prevents further attempts to use Escape or Rescue by the same target for one minute.",
  "Cheat": "This Skill is countered by Check Your Sleeves. The slide of a hand can mean the difference between winning and losing. In order to use this Skill, spend 5 Mind Points to automatically win a single die roll or hand of cards. Simply announce “Cheat” and you are considered the winner of the round. As far as onlookers are aware, of course, you’ve done nothing wrong. In the event that multiple people wish to use the Cheat Skill, conduct a brief round of betting, with each person bidding additional Mind Points. (This additional bidding is considered out of game.) The person who bids the most wins the game, though all Mind Points are considered spent. When bidding in a cheat war, you may only raise and never match an opponent’s bid.",
  "Check Quality": "It can pay to be observant. This Skill allows you to know exactly how much damage a weapon can do inherently, how much damage armor can take, as well as the Crafts Level of an item. Most of the time, this information will be on the Item Card. In order to use this Skill, you need to have line of sight to an object, and roleplay examining the item for at least 1 minute. Then, spend 1 Mind Point and declare “Check Quality.” By this same token, those that do not use Check Quality have no idea what a weapon can do, or what benefits armor can give. Check Quality may be used at check in to see the current exchange rates for currencies. While this exchange rate (based on the population of a branch’s town combined with the number of non-combat focused professions at the game) is the actual value of the currencies in play, this does not prevent characters from valuing them at whatever they feel like. Often time local currencies are worth more where those currencies are used.",
  "Check Status": "This Skill can counter Feign Death (range and duration requirements still apply). Doctor, what’s wrong with me? In order to use this Skill, you have to examine your patient for at least 1 minute and expend 1 Mind Point. During this time, you must roleplay checking your patient’s condition, such as taking their pulse, checking their eyes and talking with them. Simply watching them for one minute isn’t enough for this Skill to work. After one minute of roleplay, you may then say “Check Status” and ask your patient questions about the following conditions: how many Health Points they possess and what their maximum is; whether they are under the effects of any drugs or poisons; if they are injured, and if so what injuries and their effects; if they are diseased, and if so what it is and its effects; and whether the target is under the effects of a derangement. This Skill also identifies whether a derangement is temporary or permanent, as well as its nature and effects. This Skill does not cure anything, but does identify conditions so that they may be treated. Without unique equipment allowing otherwise, Check Status may not be used more than an arm’s length away from its target.",
  "Check Value": "When you’re buying something, you probably want to know what it’s worth. In order to use this Skill, spend 1 Mind Point to appraise an item’s true monetary value as listed on the Item Card. This Skill immediately reveals counterfeit items and currency. Certain items without cards, such as precious stones, may still have value, which can be obtained at Logistics. This ability also allows the user to check in at Logistics for the current market prices and exchange rates for major currencies at their local game. Items without a listed value simply fluctuate too much to be accurately appraised.",
  "Check Your Sleeves": "This Skill counters Cheat. Sometimes, you need to have a good eye to spot a true cheater. By spending 1 Mind Point, you can keep someone from cheating. Note that this does not actually catch a cheater in the act; instead, it implies such vigilance that the cheater is unable to sneak marked cards or loaded dice into the game in the first place.",
  "Choking Blow": "Silence can be golden— and deadly. This Skill allows you to make a silencing strike from a single Small melee weapon, Thrown weapon, or brawling strike to either the front or back torso. With a successful strike and the expenditure of 5 Mind Points, you may call ‘Choking Blow, cannot speak, two minutes’. This keeps your target from vocalizing any in game statements or noises for two full minutes since the wound cripples a vital portion of the speech process. This skill also prevents use of any skills requiring speech: Beg for Life, Challenge, Charisma, Pray for Justice, Faith Healing, Call the All Mighty, etc. This skill cannot by countered by Parry.",
  "Chop": "Even broken items can still be used as Scrap. By spending 1 Mind Point you can trade in a broken item for 1 Basic Scrap. This Skill may also be used on fallen NPC weapons or shield (not armor) to produce 1 Basic Scrap. Note that in order to receive the Basic Scrap, you have to actively roleplay taking the weapon and breaking it apart with both hands for 10 seconds. You may not just point at an item and say “Chop” while running past. If you do not roleplay breaking down an item for Scrap for 10 seconds, you will not be provided the Scrap from the use of Chop, and the Mind Points will be considered expended. When an NPC falls, their equipment (regardless of quality) will be considered in a broken state. It is suggested that players Check Quality of the equipment they are about to Chop before they Chop it. Aside from NPC weapons, you may not Chop items that do not have an Item Card. This skill cannot be used to actively break working items - that is the domain of skills such as Break Weapon and Break Shield. Instead, it represents taking an already broken item and salvaging some usable metal from it.",
  "Concentrated Fire": "This skill is countered by Avoid or Bounce. This Skill costs 1 Mind Point per use and allows a ranged shot to be counted as striking a specific part of a target, regardless of where the target is actually struck by the attack. Note that the packet or dart must still hit the target; actual misses do not count, though the Mind Point is still spent. Valid uses of this Skill include called shots on limbs, weapons, shields, sections of the torso, as well as extremities such as hands or feet. Simply call “Concentrated Fire X” where X is the targeted area. While this Skill does not cause any particular crippling or mechanically significant effect itself, it can be and often is linked with other Skills to ensure that those Skills affect their intended target. For example, an attack could go something like this: “Concentrated Fire Shield! Destroy Shield!” A packet thrown and hits that target in the leg. Thanks to this Concentrated Fire, the shield is still destroyed, as in-game the shot was considered to strike the shield.",
  "Cover of Night": "This Skill is countered by Alert. Once the sun has completely set, and once you’re out of bright, artificial light, you may travel in the dark completely unseen with the invisible symbol up. The “invisible symbol” is represented by having your arm up over the lower half of your face (think of holding a cloak in front of your face). By spending 5 Mind Points, no artificial light short of flood lights or interior building lights will cause you to be seen. Walking or running do not break Cover of Night, but speaking, picking up objects, entering lit buildings or areas of bright lights, lowering the invisible symbol or using any other Skills causes Cover of Night to end immediately. Interacting with the environment (opening doors, picking up items, talking, using Skills, etc) ends this Skill. This Skill requires unrestricted movement to use, so this Skill may not be used if under the effects of Nail or other effects which hinder movement (Mangled Legs, Binds on legs, etc.).",
  "Crop Tending": "A person with this Skill has access to valuable plants, either growing in a field or hidden in places around town, and can harvest them over the duration of a weekend. By spending the appropriate Mind Points, you can gather up the following: {li} 5 Mind Points = 1 Basic Herb {li} 10 Mind Points = 1 Uncommon Herb {li} 15 Mind Points = 1 Rare Herb {li} 20 Mind Points = 1 locally and/or seasonally available Named Herb {p} Please note that not all Herbs are available in all regions or during all seasons, and not all Herbs are able to be farmed. Using this skill requires 20 minutes of harvesting roleplay and an additional 10 minutes of role-play for every Herb gathered beyond the first. The roleplay time requirement for Crop Tending requires you mark your starting and finishing times on the back of your character sheet when you record the Mind Point expenditure (which happens before starting to roleplay). {p} The roleplay requirement reaches a cap of a maximum of 90 minutes of roleplay for a single usage of the Crop Tending Skill, regardless of how many additional Herbs are gathered on the single use of Crop Tending. After marking the use of the Skill, spending the Mind Points, and doing the required roleplaying, the player goes to Logistics where they will have their sheet checked and appropriate Item Cards given. Roleplay for Crop Tending should include activities such as checking for ripe berries, watering, weeding, and harvesting a farm-appropriate area (scratching at dirt in a parking lot doesn’t cut it). {p} Any equipment that is used during farming, unless specifically otherwise stated by the item, only effects ONE Herb during a use of Crop Tending. Unless otherwise stated specifically on the equipment, only one piece of equipment may be used during the process of farming. If a player wishes to use an item over and over to have the effect on all Herbs, then each Herb must be farmed (and collected from Logistics) individually. This will mean that each Herb will require 20 minutes of roleplay instead of the 20 minutes of role-play and additional 10 minutes of roleplay per Herb up to the cap of 90 minutes. {p} Examples: {li} A player spends 80 Mind Points and spends 90 minutes to collect 16 basic Herb. {li} A player spends 80 mind and 50 minutes to collect 4 named Herbs. {li} A player spends 5 mind and 20 minutes to collect 1 basic Herb. {li} A player uses a tool which allows harvesting non-in season Named Herbs. The player spends 40 Mind Points and 40 minutes to get an out-of-season named Herb and two uncommon Herb. {li} A player uses a tool which allows harvesting non-in season Named Herbs. The player spends 20 Mind Points and 20 minutes to get an out-of-season Named Herb. The player gets their card, then returns to the field to spend an additional 20 Mind Points and 20 minutes to get a second out-of-season named Herb.",
  "Cure Toxins": "In these times, toxins of the blood are often more deadly than bullets, claws, and blades combined, but fortunately a skilled practitioner can use simple processes to purge these toxins. If you have this Skill, your character knows how to pierce lesions, administer remedies and apply leeches in order to remove most poisons and toxins. The process takes 10 minutes, and is typically quite painful; by spending 5 Mind Points, roleplaying treatment and causing 1 damage to your patient, you can drain the toxins from your patient. Toxins are defined as ongoing Poison or Toxic effects. Some plot specific Poisons or Toxic effects may need additional time, Mind Points, use of other Skills or possession of certain materials; these details will be noted on the victim’s card or provided by staff.",
  "Deep Pockets": "This Skill represents access to steady suppliers of Herb. At Check In, you may purchase Herb at the following rates. Up to 30 Local Currency can be spent this way. {li} 1 Rare Herb for 4 Local Currency {li} 1 Uncommon Herb for 2 Local Currency {li} 2 Basic Herb for 1 Local Currency {p} Named and Seasonal Herbs may be available at their own rates based on local game plots, items, and world events. When checking in, this Skill is always used last (i.e. after Trade Ties). This Skill may only be used by a character at their home game.",
  "Destroy Armor": "This Skill is countered by Avoid or Bounce. You are skilled at putting shots in places that make armor worthless. With a single ranged attack, you can declare “Destroy Armor!” and render a target’s armor useless until it is repaired. This attack costs 10 Mind Points per attack, inflicts zero damage, and must strike the armor itself to work.",
  "Destroy Shield": "This Skill is countered by Avoid or Bounce. A shield doesn’t offer any protection if you take it out directly. With a single ranged attack that strikes a shield, you can declare “Destroy Shield!” and render a target’s shield useless until it is repaired. This attack costs 5 Mind Points per packet or dart, inflicts zero damage, and must strike the shield itself to work.",
  "Destroy Weapon": "This Skill is countered by Avoid or Bounce. Enemies become a lot less threatening when they don’t have a way to hurt you. With a single ranged attack that strikes anywhere in the center torso or weapon wielding arm, you can declare “Destroy Weapon!” and render a target’s melee weapon, bolt action weapon, thrown weapon set, brawling weapon, or bow useless until it is repaired. This attack costs 5 Mind Points per packet or dart, inflicts zero damage, and must strike the weapon or the torso of your target to work. Unlike break weapon, Destroy Weapon is able to render brawling weapons unusable.",
  "Disarming Blow": "This Skill is countered by Parry, unless the strike is made from behind. Sometimes, all you need to do to win a fight is get a person’s weapon away from them. By spending 5 Mind Points, declaring “Disarming Blow!” and landing a melee strike against the offending weapon, you can cause your opponent to drop a single weapon for a full 5 second count. Weapons must be dropped at least three steps away. This strike inflicts no damage. Two handed weapons are not dropped, but instead are disarmed from one of the two hands and un-wieldable for 5 seconds. If disarming shot is used when a two handed weapon is carried in one hand, the weapon is disarmed. Disarming blow may be used against melee weapons, bows, and bolt action weapons but may not be used against thrown weapons, javelins, or brawling augmentation weapons (like Knucks). When disarming a ranged weapon, the arm must be targeted and not the Physical Representation.",
  "Disarming Shot": "This Skill is countered by Avoid or Bounce. By spending 5 Mind Points, declaring “Disarming Shot!” and striking the offending weapon or the forearm wielding it with a ranged attack - firearm, bow, or thrown weapon - you can cause an opponent to drop a single weapon for a full 5 second count. Weapons must be dropped at least three paces away. This strike does no damage. Two handed weapons are not dropped, but instead are disarmed from one of the two hands and un-wieldable for 5 seconds. If Disarming sSot is used when a two handed weapon is carried in one hand, the weapon is disarmed.",
  "Disguise": "This Skill counters Analyze Creature and can be countered by Tie Binds. Sometimes, it’s better to not be yourself. By spending 5 Mind Points, adopting a full costume change and using a mask and/or extensive makeup, you can take on the appearance and physical mannerisms of someone else for 30 minutes. There must no question that the character using Disguise is not recognizable as their usual self. This Skill does not allow you to present yourself as a specific person, such as another player character or well-known NPC; however, you may present yourself as another persona you have created. It also makes you unidentifiable as the person that you are until the Disguise ends. Disguises may be ended at any time by making another costume and makeup change, but may not be removed unwillingly unless the Disguise user has had been restricted by the Skill Tie Binds. Use of the Disguise Skill is the only means to hide aspects of your particular Strain from the public. (Retrogrades without Disguise that attempt to change how they look must still have rotted features, for example.) Analyze Creature does not pierce Disguise; however, it will reveal a costume changed individual who is not using the Disguise Skill.",
  "Disguise Contents": "This Skill is countered by Analyze Compound. This Skill allows a Cook to slip a compound into a prepared Meal. During the use of Prepare Meal, the Cook may spend an additional 5 Mind Points to add any 1 consumable Brew to a Meal that effects all servings. When the required components are traded in at Logistics for the new Meal card, the Meal card may be attached face down or in a sealed envelope so it cannot be read, and simply labeled as a Meal on the back. When the mMal is consumed, the card is revealed and its effects are immediately taken. This new Meal uses the shortest of the expiration dates between the Brew and the Meal. Unless otherwise stated, a Meal may only have 1 Brew disguised into it.",
  "Double-Tap": "When you’re dealing with the living dead, your enemies don’t always stay down. By expending 1 Mind Point you can announce “Double-Tap!” when declaring a Killing Blow. Double-Tap not only is a successful Killing Blow, but if a creature has an ability or effect that would cause it to get up again after a Killing Blow, that capability is negated (this effect is specifically used on zombified creatures). In the event that the damage called after a Double-Tap is not sufficient to Killing Blow a creature, the cost of Double-Tap is still expended. Please note, do not attempt to Double-Tap every creature you come across- this will be a rather large waste of your precious Mind Points.",
  "Educated": "Not everyone has the benefit of a good education in the apocalypse. Going beyond the most rudimentary mathematics and comprehension of the written and spoken word, the user of this Skill has been educated in the finer arts. Not only does the user of this Skill have the capacity to understand complex documents, such as advanced blueprints, obscure texts and convoluted wiring diagrams, but an educated individual may also reduce Building A Better Tomorrow, Transcribe, and Brewing times by 10 minutes. In addition, Medical Genius time drops to 2 minutes. A character with the Educated Skill may also spend 10 Mind Points and 30 minutes once per event roleplaying researching in an environment such as a Library or a Lab (Item Card required for Library or Lab). At the end of the roleplaying period, the player may ask the storytelling staff three questions related to a Lore Skill they possess or materials related to an ongoing plot. The degree of detail uncovered by research varies from case to case, as some information is difficult or impossible to find; however, sometimes key information can be uncovered this way. When reporting this Skill use to Logistics, the Library or Lab card must be brought with the player using the Skill.",
  "Entertain": "There has to be something to break the tedium of killing zed — and Entertaining accomplishes just that. This Skill indicates having ability with a musical talent, dance, storytelling or other approved forms of performance entertainment. Players with this Skill should not be afraid of how talented they are out-of-character, but they are expected to actually perform - i.e., you cannot simply narrate “And then my character sings”, you must really sing - and must do so at least once per event so that people always know who they are. This reputation has its own advantages. At any location where a club, bar, or private social event is going on that either restricts entrance or charges a cover, a person using the Entertain skill may walk up to the front door and expend 1 Mind Point. By expending this Mind Point, the person using the Entertain skill is able to pass the doorway at no cost through their reputation as an Entertaining person. {p} A character with the Entertain Skill may also spend 5 Mind Points to do a ‘private showing.’ A private showing requires a minimum of 30 minutes of roleplay of presenting your art to a single target. Neither the person using Entertain nor the recipient may use any other Skills or be in combat. At the end of the 30 minutes of uninterrupted roleplay, the target of the Entertain Skill regains 10 Mind Points. Interruption does not cause the Mind Points to be lost, but the whole performance must begin again as the clock is reset. Multiple targets may be affected at the same time with this Skill, increasing the roleplay duration by 5 minutes and adding 5 Mind Points to the cost per additional target (everyone must partake for 35 minutes and 10 Mind for 2 targets, 40 minutes and 15 Mind for 3 targets, etc.). Only one private showing may be given per Twelves, with a minimum of 4 hours between showings; what’s more, a target may only regain Mind Points from this Skill once per Twelves regardless of the source.",
  "Escape": "This Skill is countered by Chase. You cannot use it while under the effects of Nail, a Mangled leg or Tie Binds. Standing and fighting isn’t always the brightest idea. This Skill allows you to flee from combat in relative safety. By expending 5 Mind Points and declaring “Escape!” you can take 20 paces away from combat, during which time you cannot be targeted or pursued — unless your opponent has Chase. You must flee the combat, or at least seek safety in numbers; this Skill may not be used to engage in combat (you cannot Escape into a fight). While using Escape, you can open unlocked doors; however, a locked door or Barricade immediately stops the Escape. Characters using the Escape Skill may not be carrying additional people nor items that require the activation of the Carry skill to move. Iron Slaves using their Strain advantage may use Escape with a Carry rate 2 object, however, can not use Escape while Carrying another person.",
  "Escape Bonds": "This Skill counters Tie Binds. Knowing exactly how to wriggle free from ropes and chains can be useful in a tight spot. This Skill allows you to spend 5 Mind Points to instantly remove restraints that have been placed upon you using the Tie Binds Skill. Items such as handcuffs, which have a Crafts Level to them, are more difficult to escape; each Crafts Level of the binding item increases the Mind Point expenditure by 5 points. The time required remains the same.",
  "Fade In A Crowd": "This Skill is countered by Alert. Shadows aren’t the only place where people can hide; all it takes is a few people around you if you know what you’re doing. With this Skill, you can spend 5 Mind Points to blend into the crowd and vanish with the invisible symbol up, so long as there are at least 6 people in a four foot radius. As long as you remain within arm’s reach of three other people, you can travel unseen. Any actions other than walking cause this Skill to end. Note that the Undead Hordes do not count as a “crowd” and using this Skill within a horde is likely to result in some unpleasant circumstances (mainly, a zed trying to gnaw on your leg). This Skill requires unrestricted movement to use, so you can’t use it if you’re under the effects of Nail or other effects that hinder movement (Mangled legs, Binds on legs, etc.). Interacting with the environment (opening doors, picking up items, talking, using Skills, etc.) ends this Skill.",
  "Faith Healing": "By spending 5 minutes praying, the user of this Skill may focus their divine faith into binding a target’s wounds. After 5 minutes of verbal prayer, a Faith Healer may heal 2 Health Points for every 1 Mind Point spent. Faith Healing will not purge any poison/disease effects currently active on the target, nor will it remove derangements. However, with the expenditure of 10 Mind Points and 5 additional minutes of prayer in addition to standard Faith Healing costs and requirements, you may heal a single Mangled limb. Only one limb may be mended per use of Faith Healing.",
  "Fearful Glare": "This Skill is countered by Refuse. Living in these times causes many people to become mean, but even so, some people are lot scarier than others. You’re one of the worst. With a single look, you can express to an opponent without words what it is that you will do to them if they attack you. By spending 5 Mind Points, calling “FEAR, cannot attack me, 5 minutes!” and glaring at a target while pointing at them, that target becomes frightened of you and unable to initiate attacks against you for 5 minutes. These effects are broken if you attack the target, or if later effects force that target to attack.",
  "Feign Death": "This Skill is countered by Check Status. By spending 1 Mind Point immediately after taking a wound, you may fall to the ground and feign your own death. Self-inflicted wounds do not count for the purposes of activating this Skill, though allies can hurt you to trigger it. This Skill allows you to state that you are dead to anyone who investigates your body without using the Check Status Skill; all non-zombified opponents must stop attacking you and may not declare Killing Blows. (After all, you’re already dead!) Zombies are immune to this skill, as they will continue clawing and biting a target whether or not it is living or dead. You may begin to move or use Skills at any time, but doing so immediately causes your façade to drop.",
  "First Aide": "The First Aide Skill is not used to heal wounds; however, it is capable of keeping critically injured individuals alive by preventing wounds from going from bad to worse. By spending 2 minutes roleplaying stabilizing a target, a person with the First Aide Skill may can halt the fallen player’s Bleed Out death count and/or awaken an unconscious target. This will stabilize a target until another wound is inflicted, at which point the Bleeding Out begins again. This skill does not help a target that has received a Killing Blow. A stabilized person may walk slowly and speak painfully, but take no other actions other than Skills that could be used during Bleed Out. In addition, First Aide does not halt the Bleed Out count during the 2 minutes it takes to stabilize a target. For example, if a person is 4 minutes into their Bleed Out period, they will die before First Aide can be properly administered.",
  "Fishing": "The act of taking food from the sea is much more difficult in this day and age due to the fact that so many of the waterways and watersheds are irreversibly irradiated. Fishing can still be useful, however, if someone has been trained in the effects of radiation as well as the means of catching untainted food. By spending 30 minutes ‘fishing’ by a natural waterway, the user of this Skill may expend 5 Mind Points and return to Logistics to receive Named Consumable: Untainted Fish x1. A Fishing pole of some kind is also required for this Skill. Note that Fishing does not prevent its user from activating other Skills or partaking in other activities, as long as the fishing area is set and always within ten paces. Leaving that area cancels the Skill, Mind Points unspent.",
  "Fix Limb": "By expending 5 Mind Points, and spending 10 minutes roleplaying working on a Mangled Limb, the Mangled effect can be removed. After the Mind Point expenditure and time is spent fixing the Mangled limb, the limb must be allowed to rest for 10 minutes before it will again become usable. You may not use this Skill on yourself if both of your arms have been Mangled.",
  "Florentine": "This Skill does not cost anything to use, and allows a user to fight with two melee weapons at once. These weapons must be of Standard size or smaller, and the appropriate melee weapon skills must still be purchased. A single purchase of a melee Skill, when combined with the Florentine skill, allows for usage of a melee weapon of that size in both hands at once. Florentine is not required to wield two pistols or a pistol in one hand and a melee weapon in the other, nor to have a brawler in one hand and a melee weapon in the other. {p} Once an individual enters melee range, as a safety reminder, ranged firearms must be dropped to your side and packets used. This makes most practical uses of using bolt action and melee at the same time unlikely to occur. When striking with melee weapons when using the Florentine skill, each blade may strike 3 times before Flurry rules are engaged. With the Florentine Skill it requires a total of 6 strikes (3 with each hand) to require a pause before reengaging. Unless using the Florentine skill to combine the use of two melee weapons (not brawlers), individuals are restricted to 3 strikes before the Flurry rule reset.",
  "Force Barricade": "This Skill counters Barricade. At times, survival involves breaking through defenses that others have put down. An experienced survivalist knows that the most important items are the most heavily defended. For every 1 Mind Point spent, the user may destroy one Crafts Level of a Barricade outright by striking it and declaring “Force Barricade!” Doors without Barricades or enhancements are considered at Crafts Level 1 for breaking.",
  "Forging the Future": "This Skill allows a character to take Scrap and build large projects called Augments, such as building fortifications, work areas, or structural improvements. By spending 10 Mind Points and 1 hour (30 Minutes at a Forge, 30 Minutes at the target structure) roleplaying the fabrication, the crafter may take the required Scrap cards to Logistics to be traded in for a new Item Card. All items start at Crafts Level 1 unless otherwise specified. While roleplaying making the item, you must make a significant amount of noise (there is no “quiet” crafting!). Crafting requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the crafter leaves the area within 5 feet of the Forge or target structure (except for the immediate transit between the two locations), utilizes any combat Skills, or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points spent and materials invested are lost. Some abilities or items may reduce the time requirement for Forging the Future. The minimum time for Forging the Future, without the assistance of an Able Helper, is 5 minutes at the forge, 5 minutes at the target structure. {p} Augments can be improved via Forging the Future as outlined on the blueprint provided. Basic items or Forging the Future items without improvement instructions cannot have their Crafts Level improved. During the process of production a player may only use one item to manipulate crafting times or production results unless the used items specifically state that they stack with other items. {p} The following table lists augment plans automatically known by everyone with this Skill. Note that other plans may be discovered in game with their own Mind, Skill, and Resource requirements to produce or improve. Non-standard plans must be present while roleplaying crafting or improving, and presented to Logistics when getting the new item issued. {table:4} Name of Item ||| Stats ||| Lifespan ||| Required Resources ||| Made To Last ||| Building Augment. <br /> Uses of ‘Barricade’ require only 1/4 the necessary Time & Mind within the applied building. ||| 3 Months, including one built in. ||| Named Scrap: Lead Bar x2 <br /> Rare Scrap x2 <br /> Uncommon Scrap x4 ||| Beatific Building ||| Building Augment. <br /> Uses of ‘Faith Healing’ within applied building heal 3 Health (instead of 2) for every Mind Point spent. ||| 3 Months, including one built in. ||| Named Scrap: Old World Religious Object x2 <br /> Rare Scrap x2 <br /> Uncommon Scrap x4 ||| Bolt Holes ||| Building Augment. <br /> Designated occupants of the applied building may call the ‘Escape’ Skill once per Twelves while within, and immediately move to 5 steps away from any wall regardless of barriers. <br /> Maximum 8 named occupants. |||  3 Months, including one built in.  ||| Named Scrap: Pointy Tools <br /> Brew: Glue x3 <br /> Rare Scrap x2 <br /> Uncommon Scrap x2 <br /> Basic Scrap x2 ||| Field Medic Tent ||| Structure <br /> Carry Rate: 50 10ftx10ft-ish, must be outside all other buildings. <br /> Create ‘First Aide Tent’ structure that drops the required Time of the First Aide Skill to 10 Seconds while within it, and lowers time for Fix Limb & Cure Toxins to 5 Minutes. ||| Remainder of Event.

  "Frightening Force": "This Skill can be countered by Parry if it’s delivered from the front. This strike is terrifying to all that witness it. By expending 10 Mind Points you may declare 30 damage for a single melee swing. If this first strike is successful, you may immediately turn and look at a second opponent and declare “FEAR, cannot attack me, 5 minutes!” against them. This Fear effect is identical to the Skill Fearful Glare. If the initial swing misses or is negated by defense Skills, the Fear effect does not work either. Frightening Force requires that the striking weapon be standard size or larger - it will not work with Small melee weapons or brawling strikes.",
  "Guild Membership": "Even in a dead future there are still people who want to kill, and you know people who can make it happen. This Skill reflects your contacts with representatives of Murder Incorporated, a secretive organization that takes money from clients and transfers it to others with blood on their hands. Use of this Skill typically involves making contact with a member of Storytelling staff, often at Logistics at Check In, though once you make it known that you want to put a contract out (or take a job yourself), you never know who might make contact, or when... Be advised that Murder Inc. honors its secrecy above all other things, and will terminate anyone that tries to bring them to light. In relation to Check In Skills and branch specific Guild information, this Skill may only be used by a character at their home game.",
  "Gun Aficionado": "This Skill can be countered by Avoid or Bounce. Some people are really good at making sure a bullet hits where it hurts. If you have this Skill, your character has trained long enough to become exceptionally deadly with firearms. By spending 5 Mind Points, you can deal 15 points of damage with a single firearms attack. This Skill cannot be stacked with other damage increasing Skills.",
  "Head Shrink": "Now tell me what’s troubling you. By spending 10 Mind Points and 10 minutes of appropriate roleplay, you can remove a temporary derangement from another person (not yourself, though). By spending 20 Mind Points and 30 minutes of roleplay, you can remove a permanent derangement from another person. Derangements may not be removed from an individual within the first two hours of the derangement being received (the trauma is too fresh). However, the skill fails if the derangement is gained from an Advanced Profession (for example: the Multiple Personality derangement that occurs from Thought Bender, or the Obsession: Revenge derangement that a Mountebank can acquire). At the discretion of the storytelling staff, certain other severe, long-term mental illness or damage also may not be curable - the minds of Raiders are too mutated and warped from a lifetime of savagery and exposure to radiation to gain much from treatment, for example. Appropriate roleplay can include working someone through their issues with heartfelt conversation, a pep talk, formal psychotherapy, entertainment to take their mind off of the horrors of the world, or even a religious sermon or moralistic lesson.",
  "Healthy Feast": "This Skill allows a character to produce Meals even more potent and delicious. During the use of Prepare Meal the Cook may spend an additional 5 Mind Points additional effect added to a prepared Meal. These benefits are added to all servings of the Prepared Meal. {p} During the process of production a player may only use one item to manipulate crafting times or production results unless the used items specifically state that they stack with other items. Each of the following effects can be added once. Note that a Generic Meal can never benefit from Healthy Feast effects. Some Meal recipes require Healthy Feast to unlock their full benefits. {li} Cure Onset Disease {li} Soothe Derangements (2 Hour Duration) {li} Heal +6 Body {li} Cure Toxins",
  "Holy Rites": "All priests wield the power of their faith, but those priests that dig into the scriptures and rituals of their faith find a different sort of authority available to them. While not as instantaneous or as flashy as iSlkls like Bless Weapon or Pray for Justice, these rituals possess long-term potency and can forge a true spiritual community of the faithful. In fact, it’s only after a priest has taken it upon herself to study the deeper teachings of her faith that she is granted the ability to formally induct new members of the faith. It’s important to note that all holy rites have a roleplay component as one of their requirements, which should be played to the hilt with props, prayers, music, chants, sermons, set dressing and other dramatic flourishes whenever possible. Players who fail to make an honest effort to meet these requirements may receive a roleplay violation or have this Skill stripped from them. {table:4} Rite ||| Effect ||| Duration ||| Requirements ||| Baptism ||| Formally induct a person into a recognized in-game religion. They may now record this faith on their character card; certain rituals may offer new benefits as well. Baptisms should be recorded at Logistics after the ritual is complete. ||| Permanent, though a subject can leave voluntarily, or even potentially be excommunicated if they fail to follow its teachings ||| 1 Mind Point and 30 minutes of appropriate roleplay for the ritual. Multiple people may be baptized in one ritual, provided sufficient MP are spent for all of them ||| Bless Barricade ||| Fortifies a barricade to better withstand the undead - zombies must count for twice as long each time they take down a level of the barricade, and cannot use Force Barricade against it. This ritual has no effect regarding living enemies. ||| 4 hours or until the next Twelves, whichever is longer. ||| 5 Mind Points and 1 minute of religious roleplay per level of the barricade; a “Blessed” sign with its effects must be prominently attached to the barricade as well. ||| Confession ||| The priest enters a deep spiritual conversation with the subject, removing all Fear and Terror effects. With more prolonged exploration of a target’s faith, the priest can even push off the effects of madness temporarily, easing one of the target’s Derangements for a while. ||| Instant for all Fear and Terror effects, 2 hours for temporary Derangements and 1 hour for permanent ones. ||| 1 Mind Points and 1 minute of religious roleplay with the target for Fear and Terror effects, during which time both priest and target cannot attack. Derangements require 10 minutes of roleplay and 5 Mind Points for temporary ones and 15 Mind Points for permanent ones. ||| Spiritual Guidance ||| Allows a priest to transfer some of their own energy to one of their faithful, restoring 1 Mind Point to the target for every 2 Mind Points the priest spends during the sermon. This may not take a target over their normal Mind Point maximum. ||| Instant. A target may not receive this rite more than once per Twelves, and not more than twice per event total. ||| 10 minutes of dedicated religious roleplay between the priest and their target. The target must be a formally baptized member of the faith (i.e., have it recorded on their card). {/table} ",
  "Hunter's Mark": "This Skill is the stock and trade of any good Hunter. By expending 15 Mind Points and striking a target with a white packet, for the next 10 minutes the hunter with this Skill may use Chase, Alert, and Sniped Shot on the target for the cost of 1 Mind Points per use (requires character to have these skills). In addition, a character with this Skill may spend 30 minutes roleplaying hunting and stalking of wild animals in the woods. At the end of the 30 minute period, a character with Hunter’s Mark may expend 15 Mind Points and then go to Logistics to receive a single Produce card - venison, dog meat, boar meat, squirrel, or rat meat - at random. Certain meats may also be available seasonally or due to special plot circumstances; this information will be available at Logistics as well.",
  "Improved Armor/Shield": "This Skill allows a character to Improve an existing Armor or Shield’s Crafts Level up to a maximum of Crafts Level 5. By spending 5 Mind Points, 1 Rare Scrap, and 30 Minutes roleplaying improving the item at a Workbench, the crafter may take the required Scrap card and target Item Card to Logistics to be have its Crafts Level increased by +1. Each time a suit of Armor is improved in this way, it provides an additional 5 Armor Points. Each time a Shield is improved in this way, its Bounce rating is improved by 3. While roleplaying improving the item, you must make a significant amount of noise (there is no “quiet” crafting!). Improving an item requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the crafter leaves the area within 5 feet of the Workbench, utilizes any combat Skills, or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points spent and materials invested are lost. Some abilities or items may reduce the time requirement for Improving an item. The minimum time, without the assistance of an Able Helper, is 10 minutes. Note that a Starter Item may only be Improved twice, to a maximum Crafts vLeel of 3.",
  "Improved Pistol/Bow": "This Skill allows a character to Improve an existing Bow, thrown weapon set, javelin set, or Shooter’s Crafts Level up to a maximum of Crafts Level 5. By spending 5 Mind Points, 1 Rare Scrap, and 30 Minutes roleplaying improving the item at a Workbench, the crafter may take the required Scrap card and target Item Card to Logistics to have its Crafts Level increased by +1. Each an item is improved in this way, the weapon deals +1 damage. While roleplaying improving the item, you must make a significant amount of noise (there is no “quiet” crafting!). Improving an item requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the crafter leaves the area within five feet of the Workbench, utilizes any combat Skills, or falls into Bleed Out.

The minimum time, without the assistance of an Able Helper, is 10 minutes. Note that a Starter Item may only be improved twice, to a maximum Crafts Level of 3.",
  "Improved Weapon": "This Skill allows a character to Improve an existing Brawler’s Knuckles or Melee weapon’s Crafts Level up to a maximum of Crafts LevelBy 5.spending 5 Mind Points, 1 Rare Scrap, and 30 Minutes roleplaying improving i them at a Workbench, the crafter may take the required Scrap card and target Item Card to Logistics to be have its Crafts Level increased by +1.

  "Income": "Money doesn’t grow on trees, but a few extra connections can certainly help. This Skill reflects that a person has a viable job between events; during Check In, they receive a certain amount of local currency as a reflection of their monthly income. This Skill may be purchased multiple times, up to a maximum of five, allowing for cumulative financial growth. For example, Income 1 provides 1 local currency, Income 2 provides 3 local currency, etc. This employment requires in-game roleplay where you advertise what it is that you do. Some acceptable employment examples include: scrounger, bartender, bouncer, guard, store operator, politician, gambler, pit fighter, caravan operator, farmer, fisher, entertainer, medic. (Note: While theoretically possible, openly advertising as an assassin, slaver, thief or other unsavory profession is a good way to meet local law enforcement, and it’s not likely to be for a friendly chat.) To learn this skill, you must either train yourself as a Strain Skill, or receive instruction from someone with equal or greater level of the Income Skill. This Skill may only be used by a character at their home game.",
  "Instruct": "You can save some time by teaching a classroom rather than an individual. This Skill costs 1 Mind Point, and allows you to teach a Skill that you have to an entire group of people at once. This Skill requires 5 minutes of roleplay for every Experience Point the slowest (highest cost) student must expend to gain this Skill. For example, if you’re teaching a group of five people how to Parry, and one of them needs to spend 6 Experience Points to learn it, it will take 30 minutes — even if some of the other students can purchase the Skill for 3 Experience Points. You may only teach Skills that a person can purchase from either their Profession list or their Strain list, and these Skills are added at Check In at the next 12s. Instruct may not be used to teach Professions, only Skills.",
  "Interfere": "This Skill allows its user to declare “Interfere!” and immediately take the damage or Skill effect another person would have just taken, provided the user is within arm’s length of the target. Interfere transfers all damage and other negative effects to the person using this Skill. However, once transferred by Interfere no items, Brews, armors, defensive Skills, damage reduction, psionic powers, or other status altering Skills can reduce or prevent damage and effects suffered, even if they normally apply automatically. To use Interfere, the user of the Skill must be able to take the effects of the effect and damage being called. As an example, if you want to use Interfere to take the effects of a ‘Break Shield’, then the user of Interfere must have a shield that can be broken. The same applies for all other forms of interfered skills (must have a working limb to interfere a mangle limb, must have working armor to interfere destroy armor, etc.). This skill has no Mind Point cost.",
  "Interrogate": "This Skill is countered by Lie. Every good investigator knows how to sniff out some information — especially from a guilty party. After roleplaying questioning a target in an intimidating way for at least 5 minutes, you can spend 5 Mind Points to declare “Interrogate” and force a subject to give an answer to a direct question. The question does not need to be as simple as a yes/no question, but compound questions cannot be used with Interrogate. Attempting to do so will immediately causes Interrogate to fail. The subject must give a truthful and complete answer, unless the Lie Skill is used. Once a question has been asked of a subject with the Skill ‘Interrogate’, that question may not be asked of that subject again with this Skill by anyone for the rest of the event. People using the Interrogate Skill are encouraged to ask many questions that are related to a situation instead of just asking one ‘yes or no’ question during a scene, but the subject is only compelled to answer the Interrogate ones. {p} Interrogate may be used multiple times in a particular scene, to represent particularly long or demanding questioning; each additional question costs 5 Mind Points and another minute of interrogation roleplay, and cannot cover the same ground as a previous question.",
  "Iron Fists": "If you punch things for long enough, you’re bound to build up some calluses. This Skill allows those wielding fist boffers with the BrawlinSgkill to not take damage when they block with them. To represent this Skill, a two inch band of red tape must surround the ‘wrist area’ of the brawling boffers. This Skill represents the knowledge of how to deflect blows with your hands and arms so that strikes do not land at full strength, instead of just letting your arms take the damage. The Skill Iron Fists does not prevent Mangle Limb from rendering arms useless if the strike lands on a character’s brawling boffers.",
  "Knock Down": "This Skill is countered by Balance or Avoid. This Skill allows you to step up with their shield and declare Knock Down against a target in melee range. Note that you must be holding a shield in order to use this Skill, as this simulates a ‘shield bash’. This is not considered a melee augmenting Skill, since it does not require a melee weapon to use. By spending 5 Mind Points and calling “Knock Down!” you can knock an opponent off of their feet. A person who has been affected by Knock Down can still defend themselves (block strikes, not attack); however, they must drop to the ground and take no actions other than defending themselves for 10 seconds. Note that you should not actually strike an opponent with your shield; this Skill represents that action instead. During the duration of Knockdown a character cannot use Skills.",
  "Knockout": "This Skill is countered by Avoid and First Aide. By spending 5 Mind Points, this Skill allows its user to make a single melee or brawling strike at a target’s back torso and declare “Knockout, out cold 5 minutes or until wounded!” to render them unconscious. If successful, most living creatures are rendered prone and unconscious for 5 minutes, or until they are wounded or First Aide is used to wake them up. Note that this Skill is ineffective against the undead.",
  "Lie": "This Skill counters Interrogate and certain psionic Skills. When you’re in a bind, it can be handy to be able to tell . a lie spending 5 Mind Points, you can tell one undetectable lie. This lie is to be considered truth under all means of detection; only if direct evidence is provided will the false nature of the statement be uncovered. This Skill can only be declared if another Skill is used to try to force an answer to a question or to determine whether or not a statement is true, such as Interrogate, certain psionic powers or particular Advanced Profession skills. It cannot be used to force people to believe facts independent of truth detection; however, when used it convinces the interrogator that the subject is telling the truth. This Skill may be used in Bleed Out. {p} In order to use this Skill, the user must clearly add the word “Lie” at the end of the answer that was compelled with another Skill. This declaration is purely to note the Mind Points are spent and to avoid possible confusion later. It is not an in-game announcement in any way, and acting on it is considered cheating and will be punished accordingly. It should be noted that while this Skill is quite effective if the liar is the only person who can be questioned about a matter, if other direct evidence exists then their crimes might still be found out. For example, if a character uses Lie to deny committing a murder, but six eyewitnesses saw them do it, unless the criminal can discredit those witnesses or find some other way to throw off the investigation, all they’re going to do is reveal the fact that they’re an excellent liar as well as a killer.",
  "Literacy": "Literacy costs no Mind Points to use. This Skill allows its owner the rudimentary yet sadly all too uncommon ability to read and write, as well as perform simple math and written calculations. In addition to those benefits, this Skill is vital in duplication of most basic listed blueprints and documents.",
  "Lore": "Lore is a Skill that shows your character has an understanding of a particular subject. For example, Lore: Grave Mind means that your character understands far more about the Grave Mind than the average character. In order to use this Skill, simply state the particular Lore that your character has (for example: Lore, Grave Mind) during an appropriate situation. In the case of Lore: Grave Mind, this can be examining a new creature that may have been spawned directly from the Grave Mind, or investigating some strange phenomenon occurring with the Grave Mind. That said, this Skill doesn’t mean that your character knows everything about a particular subject. Instead, it shows that your character has a basic understanding of it, and knows enough to be able to research particular topics more extensively. Lore is largely used in conjunction with the Educated Skill in order to find out more about certain topics. Simply stating the Lore without research will only give you the most rudimentary of information. For more information on Lores, take a look at the Lore section of the rulebook.",
  "Mangle Limb": "This Skill can be countered by Parry if the strike is made from front. By spending 5 Mind Points and making a successful melee strike, you can declare “Mangle Limb!” This causes the limb you struck to become mangled and useless. Only the limb actually struck may be affected - if you want to Mangle the right arm, for example, you must hit the right arm. A Mangled arm may still hold an item in its hand (loosely), but cannot in any way be used to deliver Skills, manipulate items or wield weapons. A person may still stand with one Mangled leg, but it prevents any movement faster than a very slow, painful walk - this should be portrayed as dragging the injured leg or otherwise obviously favoring it. Two Mangled legs prevents standing and any movement other than crawling in a prone position.",
  "Master Craftsman": "With this Skill a character may take any weapon, brawling augment, shield, or armor that has already been Improved to Crafts Level 5 and further improve it to a maximum of Crafts Level 10. By spending 10 Mind Points, 1 Rare Scrap, any 1 Named Scrap, and 30 minutes roleplaying refining the target item at a Workbench you may take the necessary Scrap Cards and target Item Card to Logistics to increase the Crafts Level of an item by +1 above and beyond the normal limitation of the Improve Skills. Note that these improved Crafts Levels do not give any further damage or armor point bonuses, but do continue to increase Bounce Rating for shields. While roleplaying improving the item, you must make a significant amount of noise (there is no “quiet” crafting!). Master Crafting requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the crafter leaves the area within 5 feet of the workbench, utilizes any combat Skills, or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points spent and materials invested are lost. Some abilities or items may reduce the time requirement for Master Craftsman. The minimum time, without the assistance of an Able Helper, is 10 minutes. {p} During the process of production a player may only use one item to manipulate crafting times or production results unless the used item specifically state that they stack with other items. {p} At Crafts Level 6 and above, the item is considered Master Crafted. Master Crafted items that are the target of a Break, Destroy, Melt, or similar effect are not rendered broken, but instead permanently lose 1 Crafts Level, and may continue being used. If a Master Crafted item falls from Crafts Level 6 to Crafts Level 5 again, it loses all benefits from being Master Crafted. {p} In addition to the Master Crafted benefits above, a Master e Crafted item that has been Improved all the way to Crafts Level 10 will gain a benefit depending on the Named Scrap invested during its final improvement. See the table below for details. Once improved in this way, the Master Crafted item will retain this benefit so long as it remains Master Crafted (Crafts Level 6 or above). An item may only receive one Master Crafted Named Scrap benefit at a time. Once lost, the item be Master Crafted fully to Crafts Level 10 again for a new benefit to be applied. The Physical Representation of the item should be cosmetically altered to reflect the nature of the benefit gained and the named Scrap invested. {table:5} Named Scrap ||| Melee/Thrown/Bow/Knucks ||| Shooter ||| Shield ||| Armor ||| Bronze  ||| No Effect  ||| No Effect  ||| Crafts Level Cap Increased by 2 (useful for Bounce) ||| No Effect  |||  Chrome |||  No Effect  ||| +1 damage (Does not Increase with further improvements) ||| No Effect ||| No Effect ||| Copper  ||| No Effect  ||| No Effect  ||| No Effect  ||| Repair Time Same As Per Crafts 3 Item.

  "Medical Assistance": "With this Skill, your character has gained knowledge of not only the workings of the human body but also how to quickly revitalize a person and close their wounds. By spending 5 minutes roleplaying operating on your target and then spending 1 Mind Point, your target will regain up to 3 Health Points. Multiple Mind Points may be expended at once this way without increasing the required roleplay time. A wounded patient cannot do anything other than lay prone while the user of this Skill works on them, and anything that interrupts this process restarts the required amount of time.",
  "Medical Genius": "There’s a difference between patching someone up and being able to perform advanced surgeries. With this Skill, your character has gained advanced knowledge of the medical workings of the body, and can provide treatment that borders on scientific genius. By expending 5 minutes roleplaying treating a target and expending 1 Mind Point, you can heal up to 10 Body. Multiple Mind Points may be expended at once this way without increasing the required roleplay time. A wounded patient cannot do anything other than lay prone while the user of this Skill works on them, and anything that interrupts this process restarts the required amount of time. After this Skill is purchased, time required for Medical Assistance drops from 5 minutes to 1 minute. This Skill may also be required to perform specialized medical procedures in special story circumstances; staff will provide the costs and time requirements for such procedures.",
  "Melee Weapon Expert": "Simply knowing how to swing a weapon doesn’t mean that you’re an expert. Those with this Skill, though, are another story. A person with Melee Weapon Expert has become so lethal with different forms of melee weaponry that every strike finds its way to more vital portions of the body. With the Skill, you may increase the amount of damage you can declare with a single weapon by 2 for every 5 Mind Points spent, up to an overall maximum of 20 damage. (Melee Weapon Expert can never cause an attack to inflict over 20 damage.) For example, if your weapon normally swings for 5 Damage, you can spend 10 Mind Points and swing for 9 Damage. The duration of this effect is 5 minutes. The user must stand Still for 30 seconds, with a weapon at the ready, before announcing use of this Skill as they prepare themselves with battle focus or meditation. Melee Weapon expert may only be used on weapons covered under Melee skills (not Brawling) unless equipment states otherwise.",
  "Melee Weapon - Large": "This Skill costs no Mind Points, and allows its owner to wield a melee weapon no smaller than 36 inches in length and no longer than 53 inches in length (see weapon rules). Default large weapons deal 2 damage if wielded in one hand and 3 damage if wielded in two hands. Hand and a half or “bastard” weapons fall in this category.",
  "Melee Weapon - Small": "This Skill costs no Mind Points, and allows its owner to wield a melee weapon no shorter than 12 inches and no longer than 21 inches in length (see weapon rules). Default small weapons deal 2 damage.",
  "Melee Weapon - Standard": "This Skill costs no Mind Points, and allows its owner to wield a melee weapon no smaller than 18 inches in length and no longer than 39 inches in length (see weapon rules). Default standard weapons deal 2 damage.",
  "Melee Weapon - Two Handed": "This Skill costs no Mind Points, and allows its owner to wield a melee weapon no smaller than 60 inches in length and no longer than 63 inches in length. This weapon is required to be wielded with two hands at all times (see weapon rules). Default two-handed weapons deal 3 damage. If a Disarming Strike or Shot is used on a Melee Two handed weapon, the two handed weapon is not dropped, but instead is disarmed from one of the two hands and un-wieldable for 5 seconds (cannot strike, defend, or use Skills with this weapon). If Disarming Shot is used when a two handed weapon is carried in one hand, the weapon is disarmed.",
  "Mind Resistance": "This Skill counters psionic abilities or attacks, such as Toys in the Attic, Pyro, Enslavement, Body Puppet, and others. This Skill also counters Torture by allowing you to remain silent rather than answering. A person with this Skill has trained their mind to be able to resist psionic attacks, or perhaps just survived so many they’ve built up natural defenses. By spending 10 Mind Points the user may ignore any one psionic ability or attack. This includes both mental effects such as Toys In the Attic, as well as physical effects like Pyro. Mind Resistance is also the appropriate Skill to use against Torture, allowing the user to refuse to answer a Torture question. They may not lie in response to this question - unless they also use the Lie Skill, however. This Skill may be used during Bleed Out.",
  "Murder Most Foul": "Some prefer killing others by bludgeoning them to death. Then there are others that can still a heart with one stroke of a knife. By spending 10 Mind Points and calling “Murder!” the user of this Skill may make a single attack that does 10 points of damage. If this damage is enough to cause someone to enter Bleed Out, they skip the Bleed Out process and are immediately slain as though they received a Killing Blow. This skill can only be used with a Small melee weapon or with a ranged weapon fired within two paces of a target’s back. It cannot be used in combination with other combat Skills, with the exception of Backstab. Parry cannot counter this Skill.",
  "Nail": "This Skill is countered by Avoid or Bounce. This Skill allows a person to impale a target using a javelin or bow. By spending 5 Mind Points, calling “Nail, stuck in place, 5 minutes!” and landing a successful strike with a thrown javelin or bow, the user renders a target unable to move from that spot for 5 minutes, unless someone else comes over and role-plays removing the stuck weapon for at least a count of 10. (Targets cannot normally free themselves, though certainly inhumanly strong or physically abnormal NPCs may be able to do so with the Pull Through Skill.) Persons hit with this Skill are required to lift the thrown javelin or arrow packet and place it under their arm to show that they are pinned to the spot. The attack still inflicts its standard damage.",
  "Nerve Punch": "This Skill is countered by Parry, assuming the strike is delivered from the front. By spending 5 Mind Points, calling “Nerve Punch, drop held items!” and landing a successful brawling strike to an opponent, the user can briefly shock an opponent. A successful Nerve Punch causes the target to immediately drop all items in both hands.",
  "Parry": "This Skill counters all melee and brawling strikes delivered from the front (though if one is delivered from behind, you’re out of luck). This includes Break Armor, Break Weapon, Break Shield, Blinding, Charge, Disarm, Frightening Force, Mangle Limb, Nerve Punch, Sever, Slaughter, Take Down, Wide Strike and any other basic melee strike. Being able to turn aside a blow is a good way to keep yourself alive. This Skill allows you to expend 5 Mind Points and declare “Parry!” to negate a single melee or brawling strike and its effects, provided that the strike hit the front 180 degrees of the defender. If you’re struck from behind, this Skill cannot be used, even if you knew the attacker was there. In addition, you can only use this Skill if you have a melee weapon or brawlers at the ready, as well as the appropriate Melee Weapon or Brawling Skill to wield it (if that blade is sheathed, then you’re out of luck). Lastly, Parry can never be used against the following skills: Backstab, Choking Blow, or Murder Most Foul.",
  "Patch Job": "This skill allows a character to quickly repair a Broken, Destroyed, or Melted item without a Workbench. By spending 1 Mind Point and 30 Seconds, the item’s Crafts Level is permanently reduced by 1 and is immediately repairedT.he Weapon or Armor repaired in this fashion loses the extra damage or armor points gained from that level of Improvement lost. If the item is Crafts Level 1 and cannot have its Crafts Level further reduced, the costs of this Skill increase to 5 nMdiPoints. Note that Patch Job does not restore Armor Points lost due to damage, only those lost due to a Break, Destroy, or Melt effect, returning the armor to its previous Armor Points before it was Broken, Destroyed, or Melted. While roleplaying patching the item, you should make use of props such as duct tape, twine, or a glue bottle to fix the target item. Patching an item requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the repairer utilizes any combat Skills or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points invested are lost.",
  "Pick Pockets": "Sometimes the best things happen to belong to someone else — but that doesn’t mean they can’t be yours. Knowing how subtly lift items from someone else’s pockets or bags is a good way to make a living— as long as you aren’t caught. You must carry black clothespins to use this Skill, and as with all in-game theft activity you must register with the Storytelling staff that you are using this skill. To use Pick Pocket, spend 1 Mind Point and attempt to affix one of these clothespins to a target’s purse or pocket; if it is successfully attached without the target noticing, a Staff Member will then approach the victim and obtain one item from that pocket. This item will be brought back to Logistics to be retrieved by the user later. Only Item Cards, resource cards (such as Herbs or Scraps), or currency may be stolen with this Skill. Costume pieces and prop items without Item Cards and in-game items that do not fit into a pocket, such as armor and most weapons, cannot be stolen with this Skill. The pins are to be considered completely out of game, and while someone can notice the act of placing it (and react accordingly to the perceived attempted theft), a pin that has been placed successfully without the thief being noticed must be ignored by all those around.",
  "Pistol Whip": "Guns don’t generally make effective melee weapons; but if you’re backed into a corner and all else fails, desperation can make them into small clubs. With this Skill, you may carry a Small melee weapon to represent your capacity to cudgel enemies with your firearm, though no melee related skills may be used in conjunction with this use of the weapon — save for parry. Certain weapon firearms item card allow for use of additional melee related Skills. A number of bayonet style weapon Gizmos exist specifically to be used with the Pistol Whip Skill. Firearms physical representations must be a melee weapons Small weapon able to pass a safety check in order to be used in melee, and thus must be contact safe. At no point may a hard shell metal, wood or plastic Physical Representation be used to strike, no matter how cool it looks.",
  "Prepare Meal": "This Skill allows a character to create refreshing and fulfilling meals from Herbs and Produce. By spending 5 Mind Points, the required Herbs or Produce, and 30 Minutes role playing at a campfire or kitchen, the Cook may take the required components to Logistics to have a new Meal card issued. Meals, unless otherwise stated, expire after 2 days, contain 1 serving, and require 10 minutes to consume to gain the benefits. Only one person may benefit from a single serving of a Meal. Cooking a meal requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the cook leaves the area within 5 feet of the campfire or kitchen, utilizes any combat Skills, or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points invested are lost. {p} During the process of production a player may only use one item to manipulate crafting times or production results unless the used items specifically state that they stack with other items. {p} The following are Meal Recipes that anyone with this Skill knows how to produce. Note that other Meal Recipes may be discovered in game with their own Mind, Skill, and Resource requirements to produce. Non-standard Meal Recipes must be present while role playing cooking, and presented to logistics when getting the new meal issued. Some abilities or items may reduce the time requirement for Prepare Meal. The minimum time for Prepare Meal, without the assistance of an Able Helper, is 10 minutes. {li}Basic Meal <br /> Effect: 1 Serving, Restore 10 Mind Points <br /> Requires 1 Produce, 1 Rare Herb OR 2 Uncommon Herb OR 3 Basic Herb. Expires in 48 Hours {li} Generic Meal <br /> Effect: 90 Oz of produced food. Counts as 3 servings <br /> Does not have a mechanical effect and may not be improved with Healthy Feast or Disguise Content. Requires 1 Produce. Expires in 48 hours",
  "Pray for Justice": "When used as a ranged attack, this skill is defended against only with the skill ‘Avoid’ (no other skill). Gods may be merciful and gods may be wrathful. When a truly devout person calls upon that wrath, it can be terrifying to behold. By spending 5 Mind Points, calling out to your god for vengeance and making a successful ranged attack, you may inflict 10 Blessed damage upon a target. The deity worshiped must be clearly named - if the target of this effect worships the same deity they take no damage. A person with this skill may also choose instead to spend 5 Mind Points and Pray for Justice over a melee weapon or knucks; the first three strikes with that weapon inflict 10 points of Blessed (Type) damage. In addition, when Pray for Justice is purchased, Faith Healing time drops from 5 minutes to 2 minutes of prayer.",
  "Psionic Basic Skill": "This skill is defended against with Mind Resist, if the skill targets another player. This skill allows a Psionicist to permanently add one Basic skill from the Psionics Skill List to their sheet. This skill may be purchased multiple times. The Psionics Skill Lists can be found immediately after the end of the regular Skill List.",
  "Psionic Intermediate Skill": "This skill is defended against with Mind Resist, if the skill targets another player. This skill allows a Psionicist to permanently add one Intermediate skill from the Psionics Skill List to their sheet. This skill may be purchased multiple times, but a Psionicist may not have more Intermediate skills than half the number of Basic skills on their sheet (rounded down).",
  "Psionic Advanced Skill": "This skill is defended against with Mind Resist, if the skill targets another player. This skill allows a Psionicist to permanently add one Advanced skill from the Psionics Skill List to their sheet. This skill may be purchased multiple times, but a Psionicist may not have more Advanced skills than half the number of Intermediate skills on their sheet (rounded down).",
  "Refuse": "Being able to harden your emotions against someone’s social wiles can be useful. This skill allows you to spend 1 Mind Point to ignore a single use of a behavior altering social skill such as Beg for Life, Challenge, Charisma, Entertain, or Fear. This skill does not protect against psionic powers.",
  "Repair": "This skill allows a character to repair a Broken, Destroyed, or Melted item, as well as restore lost Armor Points to armor. By spending 1 Mind Point and 10 Minutes per Crafts Level of the target item role playing repairing the item at a Workbench, the repairer may fix the item, making it usable again. Additional Mind Points may be spent to cut down Repair time, at a rate of 1 Mind Point per 10 Minutes reduced to a minimum of 10 Minutes. For example, a Crafts Level 3 item would take 3 Mind Points and 30 Minutes to Repair, or 4 Mind Points and 20 Minutes, or 5 Mind Points and 10 Minutes. Repairing an item requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the repairer leaves the area within 5 feet of the workbench, utilizes any combat skills, or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points invested are lost.",
  "Rescue": "This skill is countered by Chase. This skill allows a character to quickly carry another person to escape from a bad situation. You cannot use this skill while under the effects of Nail, a Mangled Leg, or Tie Binds, ad you must have at least one functional Arm. By spending 5 Mind Points and declaring “Rescue!”, the rescuer may use a combination the Skill “Carry 5” and “Escape 10 Paces” simultaneously on a single character within arm’s reach. To represent carrying a person, gently grip your target’s hand after calling the effect and then jog your 10 paces away from combat, during which time you cannot be targeted or pursued. All characters have a Carry Rating of 1, unless otherwise specified. Rescue may only be used on willing targets or targets that are Knocked Out Bound, or in Bleed Out. If a target does not meet the above requirements, the skill fails, and the Mind Points invested are lost. Rescue cannot be used on objects, only people.",
  "Sailing": "This skill represents access to shipping lanes and ports of call, allowing you to swap materials for cash and operate boats. At Check In, you may sell Scrap at the following rates: {li} 1 Named Scrap for 3 Local Currency {li} 1 Rare Scrap for 2 Local Currency {li} 2 Uncommon Scrap for 2 Local Currency {li} 3 Basic Scrap for 2 Local Currency {p} You may also find special items available for sale exclusively through Sailing connections or information provided to you by local ‘sailing maps’. Unique Sailing Routes, Boats, Maps, and other items can sometimes be obtained in game that open up additional trade opportunities through this skill.",
  "Scatter Shot": "This skill is countered by Avoid or Bounce. Standard firearms don't fire nearly as fast in this day and age. But with skill, and a fast hand fanning the hammer, a trained Gun Slinger can fire so quickly that it seems like all of the bullets are fired at once. With this skill, the user may spend 5 Mind Points and gesture at up to six targets within three steps. Those six targets immediately receive the damage or skill effect declared with this action, though targets may use defensive skills as normal. For sakes of unique weapon and skill effect, each of the 6 shots are considered their own individual attack. As an example munitions, Gizmos, and skills that only effect 1 shot will only be in effect for the first shot, while munitions, Gizmos, and effects that last for a duration of time or at least shots 6 shots will strike all targets. Munition, Gizmos, and effects may not be added or swapped out part way through a use of scatter shot.",
  "SCIENCE!": "Some technology that is recovered requires a greater understanding of scientific reasoning to comprehend or operate. These items have information envelopes on them with a difficulty level on the outside. A player with SCIENCE! must spend Mind Points to match the difficultly level of the item in order to figure out how the device operates. Each Mind Point requires 10 minutes of role playing investigating the item, though by spending Mind Points above and beyond the technological difficulty the duration of investigation may be reduced by 5 minutes per Mind Point (to a minimum of 1 minute). While a single individual must spend the initial Mind Points to begin the ‘scientific process,’ a group of individuals with SCIENCE! may role play assisting in order to contribute Mind Points toward reducing the necessary time. Once this time has passed, the lead character using SCIENCE! may open the envelope and read the details of the device. SCIENCE! may also be a required skill to make sense of particularly wonky Blueprints and other strange plot items.",
  "Scrounge": "There isn’t much in the way of mass production anymore, so being able to pick out the useful bits from the rubble helps. A person with this skill has the ability to pick up Scrounge cards from the ground. You don’t have to spend Mind Points to identify these cards, but you do have to spend 1 Mind Point per level of the card when scrounging. These Scrounge cards will be located across the game site, and require you to physically hunt them down and find them in order to collect them. You must spend 2 minutes role playing ‘harvesting’ or ‘gathering’ the scrounge card for each level on the card. Cards cannot be partially collected and if combat or something else interrupts you, then you must leave the card. Once you collect the card, you can turn the scrounge card into Logistics to receive a random scrounged item — usually Scrap or Herb (notated on the card). Note that if you do not have the Scrounge skill, you cannot pick up Scrounge cards from the ground or point out the existence of scrounge cards to other people.",
  "Sever": "This skill can be countered by Parry if it’s delivered to the front. By spending 5 Mind Points and landing a successful melee attack, the user of Sever can declare 15 damage with a single strike. This damage does not stack with any other damage bonuses.",
  "Shield": "This skill costs no Mind Points, and allows the user of this skill to wield a shield. Shields do not prevent damage from firearms, and may not be used as weapons. For example, if someone fires bullets at your shield, you take the damage; the shield does not block it. Instead, shields can be used to block thrown weapons, bows and melee attacks. For safety reasons shields may not have a surface area of more than 9 total square feet. Holes and carved out sections will not deduct from the total of 9 square feet of surface area. A shield may not stand more than 4 feet tall, nor wider than 4 feet wide at its widest point. {p} Examples: A rectangle shield that is 4 feet tall cannot be more than 2 feet wide to remain under the 9 square foot restriction. A shield that is 3 feet tall may be 3 feet wide to remain under the 9 square foot restriction. A “grid” shield that is a series of banded bars with open spaces still may not be more than 3 feet tall if 3 feet wide, as the interior holes do not subtract from the total surface space. {p} Items that are not crafted shields may NEVER be used as a shield. Strikes that land on ‘improvised shields’ are considered hits, and usage of improvised items as shields will result in safety violations (IE: Using a briefcase as a shield).",
  "Smelt": "This skill allows a character to break down Scrap into its component parts and refine metals. By spending 1 Mind Point and 10 Minutes role playing working at a Forge, the smelter may turn in the required materials at Logistics to convert 1 Rare Scrap into 2 Uncommon Scrap, or 1 Uncommon Scrap into 2 Basic Scrap. While role playing smelting, you must make a significant amount of noise (there is no “quiet” crafting!). Smelting requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the smelter leaves the area within 5 feet of the Forge, utilizes any combat skills, or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points spent and materials invested are lost. Other Metallurgy Plans may be discovered in game that allow for Named Scrap to be Smelted. Non-standard plans must be present while role playing smelting, and presented to logistics when getting the new item issued",
  "Sniped Shot": "This Skill is countered by Avoid or Bounce. This Skill allows a person to make a single ranged weapon attack that hits without a need to fire a dart, throw a packet or toss a thrown weapon or javelin. By spending 5 Mind Points, you can simply point at your target and call out ”Sniped Shot X!” where X equals their weapon’s damage or Skill used and damage. Sniped Shot may be used in conjunction with other ranged combat Skills, even more than one at a time, though it requires meeting their requirements, spending their Mind Point costs and adding them to the Skill call. For example: “Sniped Shot! Concentrated Fire: Shield! Destroy Shield!”.",
  "Society Membership": "Special groups, societies, and organizations still exist within the world, and whether public knowledge or a closely guarded secret, they don’t take just anyone. Society membership is only offered depending on your activities and thus cannot be taken during character creation; it can only be earned during play. Acquiring this Skill represents your acceptance into a closed society of some kind, and it can only be taught by an existing member, typically as part of an initiation process. This member is known as your sponsor, and once you are brought into the fold, their name remains on your character sheet next to your membership status. Societies may offer a wide variety of benefits, from simple social circles to access to unusual resources and expertise, though it should also be noted that all societies have rules and codes of conduct that members are expected to uphold. Failure to do so can result in expulsion from the society, and possibly other repercussions. While each society is unique, as a rule the more secretive the society is and/or the more powerful the benefits it offers, the farther members will go to punish those that stray. {p} This Skill costs no Experience Points to acquire, however, at any point a person at least two steps above you in the society - that is, one rank above your sponsor - can either reassign you to a lower member or remove your membership completely. In most societies, your sponsor is held accountable for your actions, and at any time another society member can learn your sponsor’s name (may ask OOC). New societies may not be created without written permission from the game director first. This Skill may be used, as per a Lore, to learning standing and details within said secret society.",
  "Take Down": "This Skill is countered by Balance and Parry. By spending 5 Mind Points, calling “Take Down!” and making a successful brawling attack or attack with a two handed melee weapon, the user of this Skill knocks an opponent off of their feet. A person who has been affected by Takedown can still defend themselves (block, not attacking); however, they must drop to the ground and take no actions other than defending themselves for 10 seconds. During the duration of Take Down a character cannot use Skills.",
  "Teach": "Being able to teach someone can be a valuable tool. This skill costs no Mind Points, and allows you to teach a Skill or Profession that you possess to a single student. This Skill requires 5 minutes of roleplay for every Experience Point the student must spend to gain this Skill or Profession, to a maximum of 30 minutes. You may only teach Skills that a person can purchase from either their Profession List or the Open Skill List; the Skill will be available for the student to use at the next Twelves. A new Profession becomes available at the next event; a student cannot learn any Skills for their new Profession until that time, even if they have sufficient Experience Points to do so. The only exception to these rules is if you have the Bay Walker “Fast Learner” advantage. While this does not allow a Bay Walker to teach a Profession immediately (the pupil still has to wait until the next event for it to become available), it does allow a Bay Walker to make Skills immediately available to a pupil— as long as they spend 1 Mind Point.",
  "Throwing": "This Skill costs no Mind Points to activate, and allows its owner to use throwing weapons under 12 inches in size. These weapons must be designed according to the weapon creation rules, and under no circumstances may other kinds of weapons be thrown. Thrown weapon Item Cards always represent ‘sets of 6’ and must be transferred this way. Standard thrown weapons do 2 point of damage. Improvements to thrown weapons are applied to all six items on each card.",
  "Throwing - Javelins": "This Skill costs no Mind Points to activate, and allows its owner to use throwing javelins between 12 and 50 inches in size. Throwing weapons must be designed according to the weapon creation rules, and under no circumstances may other kinds of weapons be thrown. Standard thrown javelins do 3 points of damage. Javelins must be at least 12 inches in length. Each javelin has its own Item Card.",
  "Tie Binds": "This Skill is countered by Escape Bonds. By spending 1 Mind Point, you can tie a bond on willing, Bleeding Out or unconscious targets. A Tied Bond limits the actions a person can take; bound hands prevent that person from fighting or manipulating objects, while bound feet prevent that person from moving at anything faster than a slow walk. In addition, a person with bound feet can be prevented from moving by anyone not also restrained; this simply requires gently touching the bound target on the shoulder and announcing that you have halted their movement. A section of rope or fabric is used to represent bonds, draped across both wrists of a target or tied around one ankle. (For safety reasons, a player should never be actually tied up or otherwise restrained.) Bonds may be removed by anyone not bound themselves, unless an Item Card is used that locks the binds; removal instructions will be found on the Item Card.",
  "Torture": "This Skill can be countered by Mind Resist. We do what we have to in this world to survive. Sometimes, you need to take a darker path to extract information from a subject. This Skill allows you to cause harm to a subject without killing them in order to extract truth from them. After spending 5 Mind Points, you may spend 10 minutes roleplaying torturing a subject. At the end of that time, you may ask a single, simple question, which must be answered truthfully and completely. A person must be rendered totally helpless or have Tie Binds on them to be tortured with this Skill. The Lie Skill cannot be used to negate the use of the Torture Skill, as the pain is too great to lie convincingly; however, Mind Resistance may be declared instead, which does not allow the user to lie, but does allow the victim to stay silent. {p} Each use of torture causes 1 point of damage to the target in a Torture session. Armor does not apply against this damage, nor do most forms of damage reduction, as the time required means the torturer has avoided armor and found a target’s weak spots. Torture may not be used on someone who is currently in Bleed Out, as the urgency of their own imminent death trumps the little bit of extra pain being applied to them.",
  "Trade Ties": "This Skill represents access to bartering connections, allowing you to swap certain resources for ones you need more. During Check In, you may trade Scrap and Herb at the following rates: {li} 2 Scrap &rarr; 1 Herb of the Same Quality (Basic, Uncommon, Rare) {li} 3 Basic Scrap &harr; 1 Uncommon Scrap {li} 3 Uncommon Scrap &harr; 1 Rare Scrap {li} 3 Basic Herb &harr; 1 Uncommon Herb {li} 3 Uncommon Herb &harr; 1 Rare Herb {p} Herb gained through this Skill is considered Wild and has a 3 month expiration. Scrap or Herb traded in this way cannot be exchanged more than once, so you cannot trade 6 Uncommon Scrap for 3 Uncommon Herbs, and immediately trade them again for 1 Rare Herb. You may also find special items available for sale exclusively through Trade Ties. Unique Trade Routes, Caravans, Maps, and other items can sometimes be obtained in game that open up additional trade opportunities through this Skill. This Skill may only be used by a character at their home game.",
  "Transcribe": "Being able to copy something can be crucial — especially when it comes to passing along vital information. The art of transcribing is a powerful Skill, as it allows a person to be able to copy complex documents without needing to understand what it is they contain. A person with this Skill may expend 5 Mind Points and spend 30 minutes transcribing any one Blueprint, Plan, Recipe, or other single page document. This may be done even if the Transcribe user does not possess the normally required Skills listed for duplicating said document. In addition, many complex documents require Transcribe to recreate at all. Many transcription projects will require special tools, such as the Printer’s Table or specific transcription tools or Gizmos.",
  "Trap Making": "This Skill allows a character to take Scrap and build various Traps. By spending 2 Mind Points and 20 Minutes at a Workbench roleplaying the fabrication, the crafter may take the required Scrap cards to Logistics to be traded in for a new Trap card. All Traps start at Crafts Level 1 unless otherwise specified. While roleplaying making the item, you must make a significant amount of noise (there is no “quiet” crafting!). Crafting requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the crafter leaves the area within 5 feet of the Workbench, utilizes any combat skills, or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points spent and materials invested are lost. Some abilities or items may reduce the time requirement for Trap Making. The minimum time, without the assistance of an Able Helper, is 5 minutes. {p} During the process of production a player may only use one item to manipulate crafting times or production results unless the used items specifically state that they stack with other items. {p} Traps can be improved during creation by spending an additional 2 Mind Points, 10 Minutes, and 1 Rare Scrap per Crafts Level being improved. Each time the trap is improved, it can have one of the following upgrades added. {li} Increase Damage Output by +5 {li} Add a +3 Second Delay {li} Increase the effect Radius by +2 feet {p} Traps can be attached to various objects or locations, have different styles of triggers, and a variety of effects. An item may only have as many traps attached to it as 1 more than the Crafts Level of the item (a container that is Crafts Level 3 may only have 4 traps attached to it while an uncrafted item may only have one trap attached to it). A Trap will specify whether it can be attached to an object, door, container, or ground. A Trap will specify whether it is triggered by opening a door or container, snapping a string or trip wire, a pressure plate being stepped on, or moving a target object. When a Trap is mounted via the Attach skill, the card is mounted face down or in a sealed envelope so it cannot be read until it is activated or disarmed. The back of the card or envelope should be labeled as a Trap, including its Trigger type and the Crafts Level of the trap. When a Trap is triggered, the card should be revealed, and it’s effects occur in the order listed for purposes of calling defenses. {p} The following table lists Trap Blueprints automatically known by everyone with this Skill. Note that other trap blueprints may be discovered in-game with their own Mind, Skill, and Resource requirements to produce. Non-standard trap blueprints must present while roleplaying crafting, and presented to logistics when getting the new item issued. {table:5}Trap Design ||| Affix To ||| Trigger ||| Effect ||| Resources Required ||| Generic Box Trap ||| Container ||| Open Container ||| At Arm’s Length: 5 Body Damage ||| Basic Scrap x2 ||| Generic Trip Line ||| Snap String strung between two objects ||| Breaking Snap String ||| To Springer: 2 Damage, Mangle Limb (One Leg) ||| Uncommon Scrap x1 ||| Generic Gas Trap ||| Container ||| Open Container ||| To Entire Room: 10 Body Damage ||| Rare Scrap x1 ||| Generic Spike Volley ||| Marked Paper Sheet on the Ground ||| Stepping on Marked Area (size of paper sheet) ||| Within 5’ Radius: 5 Body Damage ||| Basic Scrap x2 Uncommon Scrap x2 ||| Generic Pull Cord Rig ||| String, attached to non-container object ||| Moving object affixed to string. ||| To Springer: 7 Body Damage ||| Basic Scrap x2 ||| {/table} {p} Other traps may be created with the use of Designs. Designs may be discovered in-game and require possession of the Designs and meeting any prerequisites (often Literacy and/or Attach) in order to use them.",
  "Unlock": "This Skill allows you to bypass Lock Gizmos. By spending 1 Mind per Crafts Level of the target Lock, you may place a clothespin on the target Lock Gizmo card and begin the required time roleplaying picking the lock. You must spend 1 Minute plus 1 additional Minute per Crafts Level of the target Lock. This roleplay can be subtle, but must be entirely focused on the lock. Unlocking requires 2 Hands, and can be interrupted if the unlocker is forced away from target lock, uses combat Skills, or takes any damage. If interrupted, the Lock remains locked, and all Mind Points invested are lost. To reduce the time required to Unlock, each additional Mind Point spent will remove 1 minute from the required time, down to a minimum of 2 Minutes. Locks that have been Unlocked must have a clothespin left on the Lock Gizmo card to indicate that this Skill has been used to gain access, and not simply ignored by the player. Locks that are opened with the Unlock Skill are not broken, simply disabled until locked again.",
  "Vanish": "This Skill is countered by Alert. Versed in camouflage techniques, the user can become invisible if they have 80% environmental cover and are unobserved when this Skill is activated. Vanish costs 5 Mind Points per use. You must be prone and are unable to move from where you have vanished; however, Skills and ranged attacks do not end the effect. Only movement, the Alert Skill, or the presence of someone within 10 feet when the Vanish user activates a Skill or attacks breaks the effect. Once broken, Vanish may not be used again for 30 minutes. The Vanish Skill may not be used when under the effects of Nail, however, may be used with other forms of restricted movement (Bound limbs, Mangled limbs, etc.) Interacting with the environment (opening doors, picking up items, talking, using Skills, etc) ends this Skill.",
  "Weld": "This Skill allows a character to combine Scrap into more complicated and useful components. By spending 5 Mind Points and 10 Minutes role playing welding materials at a Forge, the welder may turn in the required materials at Logistics to convert 4 Basic Scrap into 1 Uncommon Scrap, or 4 Uncommon Scrap into 1 Rare Scrap. While roleplaying welding, you must make a significant amount of noise (there is no “quiet” crafting!). Welding requires 2 hands, and can be interrupted if the welder leaves the area within 5 feet of the Forge, utilizes any combat skills, or falls into Bleed Out. If the process is interrupted, all Mind Points spent and materials invested are lost. Many Engineering Plans require Welding, and some special Welding Plans may be discovered in game that allow for other items to be Welded. Non-standard plans must be present while role playing welding, and presented to Logistics when getting the new item issued.",
  "Wide Strike": "This Skill is countered by Parry. By spending 10 Mind Points, a user may call ‘Wide Strike’ and gesture at up to six targets within weapon’s reach. Those six targets immediately receive the damage or Skill effect of either a melee or brawling attack declared with this action, though targets may use defensive skills are normally. If a Skill is linked with Wide Strike, all targets must be legal for both Skills; however, the Mind Point cost of this secondary skill is only spent once. Example: Surrounded by shield carrying Final Knights zealots, a survivor calls out “Wide Strike, Break Shield!” and spends 15 Mind Points. Unless defensive Skills are called, up to 6 shields within melee range of that 360 degree arc are destroyed. If Break Weapon or Disarming Blow is called and a target is wielding two weapons, assume the main hand weapon is targeted.",
  "Lore - Local Area": "This Lore allows a player to research game specific details in regards to the local game area they are currently attending. A player may only use this Lore to research details of the game they are currently at, and it may not be used to research details outside of the local branch’s designated play area. Lore - Local Area may be used to research history, geography, political activity, and general demographics of the branch’s defined ‘play space’ for events that have occurred during the duration of active play. This Lore is primarily used to identify groups and organizations within an area, major historical events that have occurred, and researching recent location specific history.",
  "Lore - Animals - Aquatic": "This Lore allows a player to research details of aquatic life specific to a general region. The Lore Animals: Aquatic may allow an individual to research details in regards to commonly found local aquatic animal life, specific information on seaborne creatures, as well as identifying potential mutations and health related issues for local aquatic animals. This Lore covers most non-humanoid aquatic creatures, and does not provide information in regards to Saltwise or normally land based animals that have taken to the ocean.",
  "Lore - Animals - Aviary": "This Lore allows a player to research details of airborne life specific to a general region. The Lore Animals: Aviary may allow an individual to research details in regards to commonly found local birds and airborne animal life, specific information on flying creatures, as well as identifying potential mutations and health related issues for local airborne animals and insects.",

This lore allows individuals to do research in regards to potential health patterns, mutated advantages, potential general origins, as well as projected environmental response to these mutated creatures existence.",
  "Lore - Animals - Subterranean": "This Lore allows a player the ability to research details of primarily subterranean animals, with a focus on creatures that spend the vast majority of their life underground. This Lore is not appropriate for creatures that only nest or slumber in underground hollows, but instead should be used in the identification and classification of burrowing and primarily subterranean creatures. Lascarians, and other forms of underground humanoids, are not covered by the Lore Animals: Subterranean.",
  "Lore - Animals - Terra Firma": "This Lore allows a player the ability to research details of creatures that primarily reside on the surface of the land. Animals that take to flight, live the majority of their life under water, and reside primarily underground are covered by other forms of Animal Lore.

  "Lore - Faith - Minor Cults and Sects": "Much like Lore: (Local), this Lore allows a player to research locally approved cults and sects that are found primarily in the area of play that a character is currently in. This Lore does require that a player know some details, or information, about the individual sect or cult they are researching. Blanket research to identify all cults in an area does not fall under the guidelines of the research portion of the Educated Skill. This Lore does allow a player to identify religious tenets, symbols, local leadership, and customs of a particular cult or sect.

In addition this Lore may be commonly used in connection to Research to find details such as the location of physical manifestations of the Grave Mind, investigate strange localized anomalies, and to research details related to Grave Mind related occurrences such as Necropolis territories.",
  "Lore - History - Cinema and Entertainment Television": "Knowledge of pre-fall cinema and television shows is rare, even among the Telling Visionaries. Most information that the followers of the faith have has been repeated word of mouth from generation to generation, with very few every seeing a reliable Telling-vision oracle box. With this in mind, the knowledge of near complete scripts, anecdotes, and actors for specific Cinema and Entertainment Television programs is vital among the Telling Vision. Many religious items of the faith require either being a priest or having an extensive knowledge of the pre-fall Scriptures. This Lore is not only used primarily to research details of pre-fall TV entertainment mediums, but also used to operate or create many Telling Vision specific items. This Lore DOES NOT allow an individual to research details of historic events, news, or cultural phenomena that would otherwise be covered under another Lore.",
  "Lore - History - Fictional Literature": "Finding pre-fall literature is an extremely rare stroke of luck. Fortunately for the culture of the Strains, many of the stories of the past were translated to a spoken tradition. Fictional tales that once were held in massive tomes were simplified and adjusted to match the world of the post- apocalypse. However, for the individual who is looking to find references in the morality and characters of Fictional Literature, unearthing the original details of a story is more of a process. With the application of the Educated research Skill, a character with this Skill can search for names, places, and key story points of pieces of Fictional Literature. While this Skill may seem to lack in value, many people in the Wastelands are named after ancient tales and stories. Occasionally knowing the history of an enemy’s name means to truly understand an enemy.",
  "Lore - History - Music": "Music is a universal language that has been communicated via sound, recorded onto devices, as well as transcribed into tablature.

While this Lore, like any other, does not give a limitless resource of names and music that spans the ages, this Lore will allow a player to research key components to music. This Lore is key in the operation of many Kings Court reliquaries and devices, as well as needed for plot purposes.",
  "Lore - Medical - Diseases and Plagues": "This Lore allows a player to use the research aspect of the Educated Skill to research the details, contagion conditions, symptoms, and means to cure most Diseases and Plagues that can be contracted in the modern post-apocalypse. This Lore does not operate as a means to immediately cure all illnesses; however, it does allow a player to research historical outbreaks to match symptoms to current unknown conditions to find a cure.At times this cure may involve use of particular brewed, cooked, or crafted resources. At other times the cure may involve an extensive knowledge (lore) of Diseases and Plagues with a certain degree of applied medical skill. To identify, define, and answer questions about these plagues and diseases a player must research the details of the plague or disease via the Educated Skill.",
  "Lore - Medical - Grave Mind Infection": "This Lore allows a player to research the progression of the Grave Mind’s Infection via medical research on a subject. While it can be assumed that most Strains only have a limited number of times they may pass through the Grave Mind before they are unable to be reanimated as anything more than a zombie, occasionally the Grave Mind can cause a situation where an extra degree or lesser degree of infectious change can occur. In addition to being able to research the processing of the infection in individuals, this Lore allows a player the ability to research and have a greater degree of understanding into the processes and results of the death to rebirth cycle that Strains have when they pass through the Grave Mind.",

  "Lore - Mining": "This Lore allows a player the ability to research information in regards to underground tunnels, subterranean ore veins, artesian wells, basic geology, and the structural engineering of creating a mine. This Lore if often used in conjunction with engineered Mine locations to produce unique Scraps, additional Scrap, or used as a requirement for the operation of mining equipment. While this Lore alone is not enough to locate particular veins of materials before a Mine is forged, this Lore often times is a requirement for the use of proper engineered or tinkered tools that would dictate the kind of Mine to be crafted.",
  "Lore - Mon Histories": "Mon Histories is a study of markings, cultural symbols, and heritage related to the Genjian culture. Where Mon Studies varies from a standard Strain Lore is in the scope and application of the Lore. Mon Histories may be used in regards to research to track the family lineage of a Genjian by name, identify the family name of Burster Zombie that are carrying markings of their prior life (tattoos, family icons, weapons that are tied to family names).

The Lore of Nature: Herbs does not allow a player to research what areas produce particular Scraps, minerals, and Gizmo cards by Blueprint process, but does allow a player to identify locations from where particular Named Scraps originate.",
  "Lore - Pre-Fall History Ancient": "This Lore allows the use the research option of the Educated Skill to investigate information from the ancient time period of the year 1600 - 1900. Information gained via this Lore is very generalized, with the majority of the details from the Pre-Fall having been lost with the death of humanity. It should be noted that no Lore option exists from prior to the year 1600. This is due to the fact that the vast majority of historical documentation, research materials, and learned references have been lost. While this does not mean that ancient relics are completely lost, in the incredibly rare instance that an individual is looking to research an item from before 1600 the dating and historic information on these items is based on the findings of pre-fall humans. The key difference in this mindset is that players researching prior to 1600 are not looking into details from the pre-1600 period, but instead are researching for the research that others had made. Not only does this offer an incredibly limited view of the pre-1600 world, but also offers a large degree of contrary theories. As an example, creationist museums, religious museums, and evolutionary museums all offer contrary information. This does not even take into consideration advances of science that have corrected prior historic errors (Brontosaurus as an example).",
  "Lore - Pre-Fall History Cultural": "This Lore allows the use of the research option of the Educated Skill to investigate cultural trends, popular culture, artwork, architecture, and political culture of communities in the pre-fall environment. This Lore is restricted to first hand research from the year 1600 and forward. Any research into pre-1600 cultural trends requires the user of this lore to instead research the impressions that pre-1600 cultural trends have made on the more modern pre-fall culture. As an example, while a player cannot research the popular culture of the ancient Egyptians pharaohs, a player can research the influences of the ancient Egyptians in the artwork of the Art Deco movement. Information gained via this Lore is strictly restricted to the realms of impression, effect, and cultural response to trends. Researching details of events that have caused cultural responses requires Lore: Pre-Fall Ancient History.",
  "Lore - Pre-Fall History Modern": "This Lore allows the use the research option of the Educated Skill to investigate information from the time period of the year 1600 - 1900. Information gained via this Lore is very generalized, with the majority of the details from the Pre-Fall having been lost with the death of humanity. Around the late 1900s, with the decline of the printed medium as a primary source of communication, researchable resources became much more difficult for research and reference purpose. It is theorized that a few hundred years of life did continue after the year 1900, however, the nature and quality of life during that period is nearly impossible to research. While occasional artifacts of music, culture, and structure has survived into the post-fall era the locating and compiling of early pre-fall history has been difficult.",
  "Lore - Pre-Fall History Religion": "This Lore allows a player to use the research function of the Educated Skill to research details of religions that came and went before the fall of humanity. Many modern post-apocalyptic religions take inspiration and may even have genesis from a number of these religious sources, it should be noted that pre-fall religions (real world religions) and the religions of the post-apocalypse (in-game religions) should be kept a good distance from one another.

This Skill does not slow the movement of arms, or use of Skills that do not augment or change the movement of the effected target.",
  "Psi I - Toys in the Attic": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 5 Mind Points, calling “Toys In the Attic, no aggressive action, 1 minute!” and engaging in a ranged psionic attack (white packet), the Psion may cause a target to become preoccupied with their own thoughts and unable to initiate aggressive action. For 1 minute a target of this Skill cannot voluntarily engage in combat nor will they pursue fleeing enemies, though they may still defend themselves by using defensive Skills (Skills that do not cause damage or effects to others).",
  "Psi I - Tranquility": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 5 Mind Points, calling “Tranquility!” and engaging in a ranged psionic attack (white packet), the Psion may cause a target to feel no pain and quiet their restless mind. Any fear or terror effects on the target are immediately ended (though they are not immune to later attacks), and the target may ignore all derangements and Mangled limb effects for 5 minutes. Regular damage still takes effect and the target may enter Bleed Out or even die, though they still do not register pain. Tranquility does not suppress the effects of Sundered Limb, only Mangle Limbs.",
  "Psi I - Trickster's Mind": "By spending 1 minute in intense concentration and 5 Mind Points, you enter a state of remarkable guile for 15 minutes. During this time, the Charisma skill requires only 2 minutes of conversation to use, the skills Lie and Charisma cost half the usual amount for you (round up), and those wishing to use Cheat or Check Your Sleeves against you must pay double the normal amount. Use of this Skill does not need to be declared. This Skill may only be used by a Psion on themselves unless equipment states otherwise.",
  "Psi II - Berserker Mind": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist, if person receiving benefit of Berserker Mind wishes to resist. This ability allows the Psion to delay what should be crippling attacks for a time. By spending 10 Mind Points the target character can ignore all Skill effects and call ‘DELAY’ - so Seer is delayed, but not normal weapon swings - for 30 minutes after the use of this ability. After the 30 minutes have passed, the delay ends and all Skills and effects that were used take effect at once. They cannot be reduced or resisted in any way. This Skill does not block effects that target equipment, and all Skill-based healing effects fail for the duration of Berserker Mind. A target may not receive the benefits of Berserker Mind again for at least 1 hour after it ends. Berserker Mind does not end when a character under its effects enters Bled Out.",
  "Psi II - Body Lock": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 10 MindtPoicalling “Body Lock, cannot move 1 minute or until harmed!” and engaging in a ranged psionic attack (white packet), the Psion renders a target unable to move for 1 minute or until wounded.",
  "Psi II - Body of Mind": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 10 MindtPoideclaring “Body of Mind, regain 10 Mind Points” and engaging in a ranged psionic attack (white packet) to lend their will, the Psion may cause a target to immediately in 10 Mind Points.",
  "Psi II - Body Puppet": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 10 Mind Points, “Body Puppet, switch friends and enemies, 1 minute!” and engaging a ranged psionic attack (white packet), the Psion may cause a target to view friends as enemies and enemies as friends for 1 minute. Note that this does not compel a target to attack; they may instead choose to run if they are suddenly outnumbered.",
  "Psi II - Echoes": "By spending 10 Mind Points and spending 10 minutes in meditation, the Psion can feel the presence of those who attempt to hide themselves from sight for 1 full hour. This ability does not negate the use of stealth skills or identify who is hidden but instead allows the knowledge that people using stealth Skills are present. During the duration of the 1 full hour, usage of the Alert Skill by an individual using the Echoes power is reduced to 1 mind pointThis Skill is primarily used by Psions that work with stealthy individuals, so they know when their partners come and go. This skill may only be used by a Psion on themselves, unless equipment states otherwise.",
  "Psi II - Engulf": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 10 Mind Points, calling “10 Fire!” and engaging in a ranged psionic attack (white packet), the Psion may cause a target to erupt into flames, taking 10 points of fire damage.",
  "Psi II - Living Death": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 10 Mind Points, declaring “Living Death, 20 Body to undead!” and engaging in a ranged psionic attack (white packet), the Psionic may cause an Undead target to take 20 points of Health damage. This damage does apply to Full Dead as well as all forms of zombies, but not against the living.",
  "Psi II - Major Telekinesis": "This skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 10 Mind Points, gesturing at and naming their target, the Psion may call, “Major Telekinesis: Disarm ‘There’!” ‘There’ may be a location gestured at or described in two or three words within ten paces from where the object was disarmed. Objects moved in this way must follow restrictions of effect as outlined by the Skill Disarm.",
  "Psi II - Propulsion": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist.By spending 10 Mind Points, calling “Knockback, 20 paces!” and engaging in a ranged psionic attack (white packet), the Psion may cause a target to be knocked back 20 paces.",
  "Psi II - Psionic Surgeon": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 10 Mind Points, 1 minute focusing, and engaging in a ranged psionic attack (white packet), the Psion may soothe all derangements of their target for the next 2 hours.",
  "Psi II - Sense of Sins": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 10 Mind Points and engaging a target in conversation for at least a minute, the Psionic can then declare “Sense of Sins” and compel a target to confess all ‘sins’ of the past month. This confession lasts for 1 full minute and includes all killing, torture, theft, law-breaking, and acts of violence regardless of the target’s personal moral compass. The target is aware of their confession when it is over, though they cannot run away or stop the confession while it is in progress.",
  "Psi II - Whisper Walk": "This Skill is countered by Alert. By spending 10 Mind Points the user immediately becomes invisible to the naked eye, allowing them to raise the invisible symbol. Interacting with the environment or someone using the Alert Skill causes this Skill to come to an end. This Skill requires unrestricted movement to use, so this Skill may not be used if under the effects of Nail or other effects that hinder movement (Mangled legs, Binds on legs, etc.). This Skill may only be used by a Psion on themselves unless equipment states otherwise.",
  "Psi III - Maelstrom": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 15 Mind Points, declaring “Maelstrom, 20 Fire!” and gesturing with an open palm, a cone of fire erupts from the Psion’s hand. Anyone within a 5 foot reach and a 90 degree arc of catches fire, taking 20 points of fire damage.",
  "Psi III - Mental Armor": "By spending 15 Mind Points and 10 minutes in meditation, the Psion can attune the energy field around their body so that hostile assaults lose momentum and each melee or brawling strike received does 2 less damage for 1 full hour. Ranged attacks and psionic powers are unaffected by this skill. To signify use of this Skill a white glowstick must be worn and visible around the neck/chest area of the Psion. The glow stick or light may not be hidden, and must be visible in plain sight. This Skill may only be used by a Psion on themselves unless equipment states otherwise.",
  "Psi III - Mental Glossary": "By spending 15 Mind Points and focusing for 10 minutes, the Psion gains access to any one of the following Skills for 30 minutes: Analyze Compound, Analyze Creature, Check Quality, Check Status, or Check Value. Mind Point expenditures and other requirements listed under these Skills must still be met for per use. This Skill may only be used by a Psion on themselves unless equipment states otherwise.",
  "Psi III - Mind of a Killer": "By spending 15 Mind Points and focusing for a 10 minutes, the Psionic gains access to any one of the following Skills for 30 minutes: Backstab, Blinding, Choking Blow, or Fade in a Crowd. Mind Point expenditures and other requirements listed under these Skills must still be met for per use. During the duration of Mind of a Killer all attacks with the appropriate use of ‘backstab’ do 5 additional points of damage. The Psionic gains the derangement ‘Sociopath’ while this Skill is active. This Skill may only be used by a Psion on themselves unless equipment states otherwise.",
  "Psi III - Mind Shield": "By spending 15 Mind Points and spending 10 minutes in meditation, the Psion can attune their mind so that the psionic assaults of others are rendered useless against them for 30 minutes. When psionic effects are used against a target with Mind Shield they must respond to all psionic effects with ‘No effect, Mind Shield’. This effect also ignores all would be ‘helpful’ effects such as Jolt or Body of Mind.",
  "Psi III - Psychic Cleanse": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 15 Mind Points and analyzing a character through 30 minutes of verbal roleplay, the Psionic may remove a permanent derangement from a character. Derangements that are gained via professions or Advanced Professions are not lost, however, but instead are simply subdued for 2 hours. If Psychic Cleanse is used on a character who has gained a permanent derangement from an Advanced Profession, at their option the character with the derangement may choose to go to Logistics to roll for a different randomly generated derangement to replace the Permanent derangement that the psionic was attempting to cure.",
  "Psi III - Sundered Mind": "This Skill is countered by Mind Resist. By spending 15 Mind Points, calling “Sundered Mind, 30 Body!” and engaging a ranged psionic attack (white packet) the Psion may inflict 30 damage of pure mental trauma on their target.",
  "Fast Learner": "Bay Walkers learn from their mistakes quickly, and are quick to wrap their minds around foreign concepts and new ideas. Learning a new Skill or Profession takes only half the time for a Bay Walker. Moreover, they understand how to impart their knowledge most ef ciently, a serious advantage when both time and lives are on the line. A Bay Walker may expend 1 Mind Point when Teaching (or per student when using Instruct) to teach a skill that becomes immediately available instead of at the next Twelves. Players need to be sure to only purchase or teach skills that a character can learn before using this Skill (if uncertain, the Skill fails).",
  "Old Wounds": "Bay Walkers know exactly what buttons to push on Yorkers, and with that, a Bay Walker may call “Old Wounds, Triple Refuse Required” to force a Yorker to use the Refuse Skill three times in order to negate a Bay Walker’s use of the Challenge Skill.",
  "Toxic Shock": "With past generations having avoided the brunt of the radiation and surging waste common to many other locations, Bay Walkers just don’t have the resistance of other survivors when it comes to nasty toxins and crippling poisons. Bay Walkers suffer double damage from all sources of Toxic/Poison damage.",
  "A Tale of Two Cities": "Bay Walkers often don’t get along with Yorkers (“Disorganized beat-sticks”), and Yorkers don’t get along with Bay Walkers (“Arrogant know-it-all pricks”).",
  "Too Clever": "Bay Walkers may never possess the following Professions: Sawbones, Primitive, or Thug.",
  "Need of Food": "While the Trade Ties skill traditionally only allows Scrap to be traded for Herb, with the circles that Diesel Jocks travel in it is easier to trade Herbs for Scrap. At check in, a Diesel Jock may use the Trade Ties skill (if they have it) to trade Herb to Scrap at the same levels and restrictions as normally can be traded Scrap for Herb. Use of this Skill requires the Diesel Jock to have access to their own crafted land vehicle, or, pay 5 Herbs per Scrap of the same level, the additional difference required to ‘bribe other Diesel Jocks’ to hitch a ride to swap meets.",
  "Road Bound": "Due to their constantly moving nature, Diesel Jocks have a difficult time investing in locations long enough to generate a profit. In the instance that a Diesel Jock takes the skill Income, they will receive finances equal to two levels LESS than what they currently have. (Level 1 produces zero, Level 2 produces zero, Level 3 produces 1, Level 4 produces 3, Level 5 produces 6)",
  "Endless Miles of Road": "Diesel Jocks have a unique culture that sets aside many things that you find in ‘civilized communities’. Due to this lifestyle to the road Diesel Jocks are banned from ever having the professions Farmer, Politician, or Publican.",
  "Gnaw": "Full Dead may lean over a living humanoid that has been mortally wounded (currently in Bleed Out) and declare “Gnaw 1, Gnaw 2, Gnaw 3,” slowly and clearly. This causes 1 damage point of agonizing pain to the target while the Full Dead recovers 5 points of Health.",
  "Legion": "Full Dead may expend 10 Mind Points to place their hand out, palm open. As long as their hand remains extended and they are taking no aggressive action, zombies will not attack the Full Dead. Few types of zombies are not affected, though they will usually prioritize other targets over the Full Dead if any are available (and the Full Dead avoid attention). Use of any other Skill causes Legion to end.",
  "One of Us": "First Aide, Medical Assistance, Medical Genius, and Health restoring consumed Brews do not assist Full Dead. Neither do any consumed or inhaled effects, including both harmful substances such as poisons and beneficial status augmenting Brews. Faith Healing and injected Brews still aid/harm them.",
  "Grave Mind": "Full Dead constantly hear the whispers of the undead Grave Mind, and at times find it difficult to see the undead as a threat.",
  "Diverse Background": "Full Dead must choose at character creation to either suffer the Retrograde ‘Rot Face,’ Lascarian ‘Light Sensitivity’, or Pure Blood ‘Weakness to Radiation’ Flaw. High society backgrounds would suffer from the Pure Blood flaw; members of London’s famed Cockney underground suffer from ‘Light Sensitivity’; and lower class longshoremen and other manual laborers the Retrograde ‘Rot Face’.",
  "Social Observer": "Genjian are well-traveled as a rule, with a keen eye for social customs. After silently watching an organized social event –dinner, religious rite, party, court, etc.– for twenty minutes, a Genjian may approach an individual and expend 5 Mind Points to utilize the Charisma Skill. They may do this more than once, provided it is during the same social event and each target is a participant. This bypasses the conversation requirement for Charisma.",
  "Know Your Enemy": "If a Genjian identifies an opponent with Analyze Creature and possesses the appropriate Lore skill for that enemy’s creature type or survivor Strain, they inflict an additional point of damage with brawling, melee, thrown or bow attacks against that enemy.",
  "The Long Walk": "Genjian fear that their immortal soul will be forever damned if they become undead. Because of this Genjian follow a specific ritual when they know their time is near (when Infection drops to 1). The Genjian gathers their friends together and gives away all possessions except a single weapon. After saying goodbye, the Genjian finds a silent place to commit suicide. If this rite is interrupted, or if the Genjian is stabilized or healed before final death, instead of being healed the Genjian immediately rises as a rank 4 Burster. (Consult the staff in advance.)",
  "Honor Bound": "Genjian do not suffer disgrace to their family. It is not uncommon for Genjian to demand satisfaction from or even honor duel those that besmirch their family’s name.",
  "Able Helper": "If an Iron Slave roleplays assisting someone using the Building Tomorrow or Brewing Skill, the Iron Slave may expend 2 Mind Points to reduce the production time by 10 minutes (to a minimum of 2 minutes). Each Iron Slave may only use this Skill once per item being crafted or brewed, however, other Iron Slaves may assist and stack use of this Skill (once per Iron Slave). An Iron Slave may not activate this Skill for something they are creating themselves.",
  "Strong Back": "Iron Slaves are accustomed to hard work, and for all mechanical purposes, are considered to always have a Carry of 2 instead of the standard 1 that all other strains have. At base, Carry 2 allows carrying one person at a run or two at a walk. Items may be marked with a Carry rate as well, requiring that much Carry rating to move. The skill ‘Carry’ can be used to increase this advantage for short periods of time– an increase of 1 grants an Iron Slave have a carry rate of 3, etc.",
  "Bioluminescent": "Iron Slaves glow and are branded as property. Because of these unique aspects, Iron Slaves can never use the following skills: Cover of Night, Disguise, Fade in a Crowd, or Vanish.",
  "Humble Roots": "Due to their deprived origins, Iron Slaves may not come into play with any of the following starting professions: Caravan Driver, Distiller, Doctor, Gambler, Hook-Up, Mad Scientist, Martial Artist, Psionist, Sniper, Spy, or Tinker. These professions, if applicable, can be learned in game via standard means. While Psionist cannot be taught as a Profession, items and means do exist to allow Iron Slaves to learn Psionist post-character creation.",
  "Cannibalism": "A Lascarian can regain 2 Health Points by consuming the flesh of a dead humanoid (not undead, downed zombies have no nutritional value), provided that it has died within 5 minutes. Only one Lascarian may regain these points per corpse – others may role play ‘digging in’ if they like, but only one person receives the Health Points. If in doubt, the first person to start feeding receives this benefit. Cannibalism must be role played for at least 2 minutes. Lascarian players are encouraged to carry fake body parts on them for when a person portraying an NPC needs to quickly leave instead of waiting to be consumed. Given that former living humanoids rot into the earth 5 minutes after Killing Blow, slow reacting cannibals go hungry.",
  "Light Sensitivity": "Lascarians are raised in dark underground areas, and because of that, they must expend an additional Mind Point for every Skill they use while the sun shines bright on them. 100% skin cover is required to avoid this effect, even during overcast days, and dark glasses or goggles are part of this requirement.",
  "Savage Culture": "Lascarians are banned from ever having the following Professions: Charlatan, Entertainer, Gambler, Hook-Up, Merchant, Of cer, Politician, Ring Leader",
  "Merican Mob": "Mericans have a tendency to celebrate in unruly numbers. Mericans gathered in celebration may regain 10 Health Points per half hour of celebration as long as five Mericans are part of the celebration and each has consumed at least one brewed item (requires Brew card).",
  "Social Pariah": "Mericans can never tell when they are interrupting or intruding on a private social situation, unless it is specifically pointed out to them. This does not mean they are deliberately rude –though they certainly can be!– just that they have no natural ability to tell when they’re not wanted, at least not until they’re told. Thus even well-intentioned Mericans often find themselves offending others by offering advice when none is desired, approaching people who obviously want to be left alone, or speaking up at a gathering where they’re clearly an outsider.",
  "Yeeee-Haaaaw!": "Lacking subtlety, Mericans can never have the professions of Martial Artist or Spy.",
  "Meditation": "An Accensor regains 5 Mind Points and 5 Health Points for every 30 minutes in active prayer. During prayer, the Templar may take no other actions, use no skills, and must remain unmoving. They may speak briefly, but must devote the majority of their attention to silent motionless prayer. While these rituals are specific to each person, it should be obvious through props and behavior that the Accensor is engaged in some kind of religious or meditative activity, and not simply napping or staring off into space. Sleep, day-to-day activities, and other forms of ‘I am meditating while I do other things’ are not appropriate. The Skill meditation is an introspective and collecting of will related directly to being an Accensorite, not specifically linked to the Accensorites morality or faith.",
  "Blessed Life": "Accensorites may begin play already baptized to one of the major in-game faiths. (Lesser faiths always require in-game baptism.) They may choose not to do so, but until they are formally baptized into some kind of faith their Meditation ability requires 1 hour of prayer or meditation instead of 30 minutes.",
  "Code of Ethics": "Each Accensor has a strict moral code that they adhere to unwaveringly, and find themselves alienated by those who do not follow their zeal. Many Accensor base their moral code on the tenets of their faith –see the Religion branch for details– and those that do not follow established larger faiths should submit their code to the storytelling staff for approval, in order to ensure that it is suitably representative of their strong sense of morality. Accensorites that do not follow their code may have their Strain advantages suspended until they atone.",
  "First In Last Out": "Regardless of their individual beliefs, members of the Nation of Accensor always put the well-being of others of their faith above their own. An Accensorite cannot tend to their own wounds until all other injured members of their own faith that are present are taken care of.",
  "Natural Aim": "Due to their incredible skill with primitive weapons, Natural Ones do one additional point of damage with bows, melee, and thrown weapons.",
  "Shun the Boomstick": "Bolt Action and all ranged skills (requiring technology) cost double the number of Experience Points to purchase.",
  "Xenophobic": "Anyone not of your tribal structure, even if they are other Natural Ones from different societies, is treated with a degree of distrust.",
  "Backward": "Natural Ones may not begin play with the Mad Scientist, Engineer or Gun Slinger professions, though they may acquire them later during play.",
  "Investment": "All Pure Bloods receive one additional Credit for each level of Income they have.",
  "Weakness to Radiation": "When the apocalypse began, the Pure Bloods were confident that strong walls and hardened mercenaries could keep raiders and zombies at bay, but they were terribly paranoid regarding the unseen threat posed by radiation. Most took extreme precautions to avoid even mild exposure, and many families still shun the slightest contact with radiation in order to prevent the “pollution” of their bloodline due to mutation. Because of this, Pure Bloods have not been hardened to radiation nearly as much as other survivors, and suffer terribly in its presence, sometimes as much from fear and anxiety as actual harm. All damage (to armor or health) done by radiation causes the loss of an equal number of Mind Points. This very quickly makes a Pure Blood near useless in “hot” parts of the wasteland.",
  "Peacocks": "Pure Bloods pride themselves on their fashion. Any time that a Pure Blood is not wearing at least 4 different visible colors (of sizable portions), elaborate jewelry, and/or extensive makeup, the Charisma skill costs double for the underdressed Pure Blood, and using Refuse against the Charisma skill of other Pure Bloods also costs double. When costuming, please keep the genre aesthetics in mind.",
  "Dead Nerves": "At the cost of 10 Mind Points, Reclaimers may call ‘Dead Nerves’ as a response to Sunder Limb or Mangle Limb. The effect of the Mangled Limb or Sunder Limb is negated, as if the strike or ranged attack had been parried or avoided. In the instance that an effect would trigger multiple Mangled or Sundered Limbs in a single attack, on a single use of Dead Nerves is required. Dead Nerves must be recorded the same as per any other Skill use. Dead Nerves may be used during Bleed Out or while unconscious as long as the Skill response is declared within 3 seconds of the attack/effects use.",
  "Selective Breeding": "The Reclaimers are accustomed to being ‘us versus them’ in regards to survival. Due to their secluded nature, it is difficult for Reclaimers to truly open up to outsiders (non-Reclaimers). Due to this social echo-chamber, uses of Charisma and Entertain cost 10 Mind Points when targeting non-Reclaimers.",
  "Collective Pride": "Members of the Red Star cells are deeply linked to one another, and that loyalty has strength. No effects can ever force a member of the Red Star to attack or betray their fellow Red Star, not even zombification.",
  "Reject Free Enterprise": "Reds do not believe in capitalist systems and as a result reject the symbols of the capitalist free market. Red Star may not possess nor accept any forms of currency (credits, gems, marks, etc.) nor willingly partake in the capitalist free market.",
  "Opiate of the Masses": "Reds can never follow any faith or religion, nor can they ever have the following professions: Caravan Driver, Charlatan, Entertainer, Gambler, or Priest. In addition, Red Star may never receive the benefits of faith powered Skills (Call the All Mighty, Faith Healing, Holy Rites, Live Again, Life Giver).",
  "Dabbler": "Remnants start with two Professions instead of the standard one.",
  "Rootless": "Remnants do not have any Strain Skills, and by that, cannot self-teach.",
  "Love Me": "In hopes of finding a means of acceptance, all Remnants must join an organized faith as soon as possible once they enter play. Remnants will generally put extra effort into being recognized by other members of their faith, though generally not to overzealous or antisocial extremes. Should a Remnant not have been baptized into a recognized faith by their sixth game event, they lose all access to or benefits from any Skills from their second Profession, and cannot learn any new Skills for that Profession until they are so baptized. Only events attended as the Remnant character count toward this time limit – missed events or events played as a different character do not count. If a Remnant leaves their faith later on during play, willingly or otherwise, this should be marked as “Crisis of Faith” on their card. Once again they have five events to join another religion or lose the benefits of their second Profession. This includes the event where their faith was lost. This disadvantage never affects a third Profession. It does not automatically affect Advanced Professions – unless the lost Profession is prerequisite. If so, the character loses access to their Advanced Profession so long as they are also denied the use of their second Profession.",
  "Not Like the Others": "As noted previously, Remnants may not have unique physical appearance traits specific to other Strains (red glow, rotted faces, angelic traits, etc).",
  "Half-Life": "Retrogrades take half damage from all Radiation sources, rounded down.",
  "Rot Face": "Retrogrades are hideously mutated and have the effective appearance of undead. In a shoot first and don’t ask questions environment, this often causes a fatal first impression.",
  "Unfriendly Face": "Retrogrades must expend two additional Mind Points when attempting to use Charisma when not wearing a mask.",
  "Bond of Salt (adv)": "To share food and drink with someone is to take responsibility for them, and often their well-being is more important than a tarnished reputation. Once per Twelves, a Rover may opt to lose up to 10 Health to allow another to recover the same. This advantage requires food or drink to be consumed at the Rover’s home/campsite/place of business and at least 10 minutes of roleplay.",
  "Bond of Salt (dis)": "If a Rover consumes food or drink from an individual, all skills that would adversely affect the sharer cost 2 additional Mind Points for the next hour or while they remain in their home/campsite/place of business (whichever is longer).",
  "Word of Bond": "If any deal a Rover makes is broken by the other party, they will pursue justice and exact reparation until the wrong is redressed to their satisfaction, with two-fold rancor. Further, a Rover cannot willingly break a formal deal that is shaken on under any circumstance. If fate prevents them from keeping their word, they make no excuses, and will seek to right the wrong immediately, to the exclusion of all else. Skills and effects may force a Rover to fail to uphold their word; however, they still feel obligated to either complete the deal or to right the wrong.",
  "Oceanic Masters": "Salt Wise using the Fishing Skill may utilize thrown weapons, melee two handed, javelins, or bolt action weapons instead of a fishing pole physical representation. When fishing the Salt Wise using a two handed melee weapon, thrown weapon, or bolt action weapon instead of a fishing pole physical item, the Salt Wise may spend an additional 5 Mind Points per use of the Fishing skill reduce the time required for  shing to 1 minute. This Skill does not lower the required roleplaying time for fishing augments such as Boats, Gizmos, or Unique Items. If a Salt Wise is gaining the advantage of these unique augment items, then the Salt Wise may not benefit from the Oceanic Master time reduction.",
  "Water Breathers": "Salt Wise are immune to damage taken from ‘Pull Under’ as well as most forms of drowning damage.",
  "Ocean Bound": "Salt Wise cannot spend extended time away from the open ocean. Salt Wise do not refresh Mind Points at the 12s if they are at an event that is more than 75 miles from the ocean (must be ocean). Due to the shifts and changes of post-apocalypse maps, players and branches should use real world shore to game site measurements to determine if this flaw applies.",
  "Debts Owed": "Most Salt Wise tribes owe debts to organizations such as the Guild and Murder Inc. With many of their family members actively working with or for Murder Inc., Salt Wise pay the ultimate price if one of their family members fails to pay their debts. At times Directors or assigned Storytellers may provide tasks to players of Salt Wise that must be completed without reward. If these tasks are not completed, the repercussions of failure may involve back story family being punished or contracts being leveled against any number of Salt Wise in play. These assignments from Murder Inc. do not require the Salt Wise to be a Guild Member, or to even be an assassin type character.",
  "Hunter's Claws": "All Semper Mort have twisted hands and pronounced nails, but some develop these claws into dangerous weapons. If a Semper Mort learns the Brawling Skill, they can use claws as base 3 damage weapons. Red brawler beaters are used as the physical representation of these claws. Knucks cannot be used on claws, but applied poisons may be used on them. The Iron Fists Skill is still required to block using claws without taking damage.",
  "Mortal Bonds": "Semper Mort may heal 1 point of Health by draining 2 points of Health by biting living targets and draining their blood. This attack requires the use of their Hunter’s Claws (and thus the Brawling Skill) by striking with both red brawler beaters at the same time. If both beaters strike their target, the Semper Mort is considered to have grabbed the target with both claws and can bite the target. The Semper Mort does not need to strike again, but instead just holds both beaters on the target and counts for three seconds: “Bite 1, Bite 2, Bite 3, 2 damage”. If the target breaks free of either brawler, the bite comes to an end.",
  "Blood is the Life": "Semper Mort in Bleed Out may be stabilized as though First Aide had been used on them by having someone feed 10 Health points of blood from damage. Note that blood cannot be carried or preserved in-game without use of a suitable recipe or device.",
  "Curse of Slumber": "All Semper Mort begin play with the Derangement: Amnesia, which can never be soothed or removed. All knowledge of existence prior to becoming Semper Mort is lost forever.",

  "Twisted Hands": "Semper Mort can never learn the Pugilist profession, cannot use Knucks (with or without their claws), and may not begin play with the Martial Artist profession.",
  "Middle Manager": "Solestros have evolved to become some of the most charismatic ‘hands-on bosses’ in the wastelands. Whenever using the Skill Charisma, they may use the Skill with a ‘By My Voice’ effect at the expenditure of an additional 10 Mind Points beyond their cost for using Charisma. Instead of requiring social interaction with each individual target for 5 minutes, the user of Middle Manager must engage in a combination of menial labor and conversation with at least 3 targets for 10 minutes. No effects may ever lower the cost of this additional 10 Mind Point expenditure, and during the 10 minutes prior roleplay all the way until the By My Voice effect is called, the Solestros may not leave a 10 foot area (no starting the effect and then walking into another area to trigger it). The effects of Middle Manager share the effects, duration, and restrictions of the Charisma Skill. Targets that enter the room after the start of the 10 minute roleplay are still effected by the ‘By My Voice, Charisma’.",
  "Second in Command": "Pure Bloods are immune to all uses of Charisma, Cheat, Fear, and Lie used by a Solestros.",
  "Glass Ceiling": "Solestros are victims of Pure Blood financial warfare.

While the Unborn of Têixiptla will still take the initial damage of ranged attacks, melee, or brawling strikes that have one of these damage modi ers; the Unborn of Têixiptla will not suffer the ill effects normally related with Poison, Disease, or Radiation. This includes being immune to area effects, location (module) effects, or traps that use these three modifiers. The Undead Hearts advantage does not prevent damage from poisons or effects that cause either Psion Bane or Unborn of Têixiptla Bane. (Example: By my Voice 5 Poison was called. The Unborn calls Undead Heart and takes no damage. Second Example: The Unborn is stabbed with a blade that normally does 3 damage, but has a poison on it that does +5 Poison damage. The Unborn takes 8 damage, but is not poisoned.)",
  "Limited Potential": "The Unborn of Têixiptla are banned from ever having the professions Engineer, Mad Scientist, or Psionist.",
  "Called to the Grave": "When a Unborn reaches Bleed Out, they reach a strange calm state as the Grave Mind calls to them. During bleed out an unborn cannot inject themselves with Brews, activate Gizmos to generate stabilization or healing effects, or even yell or call out for help. Unborn in Bleed Out are eerily calm as they are bleeding out to death, however, if asked they may calmly answer that yes... they are indeed dying (or going home).",
  "Meat Market": "A Vegasian can spend five Mind Points to receive an advantage similar to the ‘Entertain’ skill for slave camp communities. While this does not prevent the encampment from double-crossing the Vegasian later, it at least gets the individual in the door as a free slave owner. Using this advantage only encourages the distrust of Vegasians by civilized society, however, and most Vegasians know better than to use it in the presence of members of other Strains.",
  "Coward's Way Out (AKA Buddy Fucker)": "Vegasians are notorious for their ability to put others between themselves and harm’s way. Once per event, a Vegasian may declare “Coward’s Way Out” immediately after receiving an injury or harmful effect from an outside source, and nominate a person in brawling range. (They cannot select the source of the damage.) That person becomes the new target of the attack or harmful effect. They may not apply defenses against this attack. Melee, ranged, psionic and even trap effects may be redirected with Coward’s Way Out, though Area of Effect attacks nor ingested damage cannot.",
  "Born Coward": "Any power, Skill, or effect that causes a Vegasian to defend against a fear or terror effect must be activated twice for every single such effect used against them. Vegasians are cowards by default, and the very concept of staying in a  fight when instinct tells them to leave is completely alien to them.",
  "Bad Rap": "Vegasians are universally distrusted, considered criminals by most everyone they meet, and always assumed to be up to no good.",
  "Shady Dealers": "Vegasians are banned from ever having the professions of Guard, Gun Slinger, Martial Artist, and Officer.",
  "Pissed-Off Yorker": "Every Yorker has a mean streak in them that comes out especially strongly when they feel they are being kicked around. If a Yorker is put into Bleed Out and then stabilized and healed, the first strike they make after being ‘taken out of the fight’ inflicts three additional points of damage. This strike must be within 10 minutes of being knocked down; otherwise the Yorker calms down and does regular damage. During these 10 minutes the Pissed-Off Yorker is also immune to Fear, Terror, and Charisma effects.",
  "Commitment Issues": "Yorkers have a hard time trusting others, but when they do, they become unwaveringly loyal. Once a Yorker has chosen to let someone past the hard outer shell they will do anything for them, including putting themselves in danger or even facing certain death to protect them.",
  "Angry Streak": "Yorkers are easily goaded into a fight, and when Challenge is used on them they must expend twice for Refuse to negate the effects of Challenge. In addition, Yorkers have a natural hatred for Bay Walkers. Refusing a Challenge from a Bay Walker requires three expenditures of Refuse to negate the effects of Challenge.",
  "Mean Streets": "Yorkers are banned from ever having the following professions: Charlatan, Officer, and Politician.",
  "Close The Distance": "Fighters that rely on quick strikes, quick hits, and speed have their lives depend on controlling their location on the battle field.  Being able tomove into short range quickly is just as important as being able to get out of fighting range. When using Close the Distance, the player using this Skill may spend 20 Mind Points and loudly declare ‘Close the Distance.’ Once Close the Distance is declared, the user of this Skill places their out-of-character signal over their head and sprint up to 20 steps to a target person. Once the person using Close the Distance stops taking steps, has five seconds pass, or reaches their target, the player drops their out-of-character signal. When Close the Distance is used, any of the following effects that the user is currently under immediately come to an end: Berserkers Mind, Cover of Night, Whisper Walk, and Fade in a Crowd.",
  "Disengage":  "Controlling the battlefield often is the difference between life and death for the fighter who relies on speed and positioning. In the instance that the character with the skill Disengage has had a melee strike parried, delayed, or if the strike has ‘no effect,’ the character with this skill may immediately spend 20 Mind Points and call ‘Disengage’. The player using Disengage may put the out-of-character symbol over their head, and take up to 10 steps away from their target. Once the person using Disengage stops taking steps or has five seconds pass, the player drops their out-of-character signal. Chase does not prevent the use of Disengage, however, a character with at least one Mangled or Severed leg may not use Disengage. When Disengage is used, if the player has the Skills Cover of Night, Whisper Walk, or Fade in a Crowd, those Skills may be spent for and activated while the Disengaged character is traveling out-of-character. These additional Skill uses have the standard restrictions and costs related to use of those Skills.",
  "Keen Eyes": "A character with the Agility Focus Combatant concentration has the ability to be a stealth combatant’s worse enemy. The Agility Focus Combatant with the Keen Eyes skill can expend 20 Mind Points and call ‘By my voice, Alert!’ This effect triggers on all targets, friendly and unfriendly, within the range of the Keen Eyes Skill.",
  "Heavy Ordnance": "Allows for the use of Heavy Ordnance weapons.  Heavy Ordnance weapons are produced with the Custom Modifications skill via the Quality Producer Profession Concentration.  Heavy Ordnance weapons are capable of using Skills linked with both firearms and thrown weapons assuming the user of this Skill has access to the linked firearm or thrown weapon Skill. In addition, all Heavy Ordnance weapons may use both Firearm and Bow Gizmos and custom ammo. Heavy Ordnance Physical Representations should be massive pieces of equipment that are marked with a bright yellow band, signifying that they may only be used by an individual with the Heavy Ordnance skill. Heavy Ordnance weapons should have the visual appearance of monster weapon systems that utilize pulleys, recoil systems, and oversized payload launchers.",
  "Reloading is Stupid": "When your life is determined by the guns you carry and the bullets you fire, running out of ammunition can mean your death.  Long Range Combatants with the Reloading is Stupid skill may increase their total carried dart total from 20 darts to 50 darts that may be stored in multiple clips. Long Range Combatants using this Skill are still responsible for policing their own brass (picking up their darts after a firefight). In the instance that darts are found on the site by staff members at the end of an event, those darts may be returned to the player using this Skill via NPCs attempting to assassinate the character in question.  All darts MUST be marked with the characters player number.",
  "Improvised Thrown Weapon": "Throwing weapons are items that have been balanced and designed in such a way to either fly through the air like a dart, or to have a certain number of rotations per yard to allow the weapon to land with its sharpened edge or point in a target. Throwing weapons effectively that are not designed to be thrown is difficult, and, requires a great amount of skill. With the Improvised Thrown Weapons Skill the character with a Range Combat Focus may improvise thrown weapons. When using Improvised Thrown Weapons, the user of this Skill spends 10 Mind Points and 5 minutes roleplaying scrounging for improvised thrown weapons. The character using this Skill must not be Bound or be suffering from Mangled/Severed arms. After the 5 minutes of roleplaying and the 10 Mind Points spent, the user of this Skill can pull out 10 Improvised Thrown Weapon Physical Representation. These improvised thrown weapons may be orange packets, or, small improvised thrown weapon Physical Representations with an orange and green stripe. These Physical Representations are only usable by the individual with Improvised Weapon, and is only usable for 10 minutes before the item are no longer usable.  The improvised thrown weapon only does one damage, but can be used as an appropriate thrown weapon or javelin weapon for skill use. When Improvised Weapon is not being used, the thrown physical representations should be carried on the player but kept as out of sight as possible as to not disrupt roleplay.",
  "Pole-arm Weapon Mastery": "Allows for use of melee Two handed weapons that are 80 inches in length or less. These Melee weapons require 45 degree swings instead of 90 degree swings due to the additional force that would be produced from the larger weapons. These larger Two handed weapons must be marked with a bright yellow band, signifying that they may only be wielded by an individual with Pole-Arm weapon mastery. Pole-arm Weapon Mastery weapons are produced via the Quality Producer Skill: Made to Order.",
  "Call for Phalanx": "Allows a shield wielding character to spend 20 Mind Points and call, ‘By My Voice, Call for Phalanx!’ When Call for Phalanx is activated, up to 8 shield wielding characters may form a box, circle, or line formation within 5 steps of the user of Call for Phalanx. For 10 minutes all shield wielding members of the Phalanx, as long as they remain within 5 steps of the user of Call for Phalanx and continue to wield their shields, may ignore all uses of Fear, Nightmares, and *ALL* area effect or ‘By My Voice’ effects. When ignoring the effects of an attack or effect due to Phalanx, the defender must call ‘DEFENDED, PHALANX’ within 3 seconds of the attack being sounded. Area effect damages include all uses of Wide-Strike, psionic area effects, By my Voice attacks, and Area Effect traps. While Call for Phalanx is active, no members of the Phalanx may move faster than a half time marching step. If at any point during the use of Call for Phalanx the user of Call for Phalanx is dropped into Bleed Out or rendered asleep or unconscious Call for Phalanx immediately comes to an end. It is the responsibility of the individual using Call for Phalanx to ensure that individuals joining in the use of the skill understand the restrictions and uses of Call for Phalanx. If any individuals that are a part of a use of Call for Phalanx leaves the range of the Phalanx, the Skill immediately comes to an end.",
  "Improvised Weapon": "Being skilled with many close range melee weapons often means being capable to use most items as a weapon. With this Skill, a Short Range Combatant may carry a contact safe melee weapon on them that represents an improvised Small, Standard, or Large melee weapon (they may carry multiple of these if they wish). This weapon must match to a melee weapon Skill that the character with Improvised Weapon current has. This melee weapon must be marked with a yellow and a green band to signify that the object is only usable by characters with the Improvised Weapon Skill and is not an item actually carried at all times. When using Improvised Weapon, the user of this skill spends 10 Mind Points and 5 minutes roleplaying scrounging for an Improvised Weapon. The character using this Skill must not be bound or be suffering from Mangled/Severed arms. After the 5 minutes of roleplaying and the 10 Mind Points spent, the user of this Skill can pull out their stored ‘improvised weapon’ Physical Representation. This Physical Representation is only usable by the individual with Improvised Weapon, and is only usable for 10 minutes before the item ‘breaks’. The improvised weapon only does one damage, but can be used as an appropriate melee weapon for Skill use. When Improvised Weapon is not being used, the melee Physical Sepresentation should be carried on the player but kept as out of sight as possible as to not disrupt roleplay.",
  "Savior of Life": "The Savior of Life skill requires the user of Savior of Life to have the First Aid Skill.  For 5 Mind Points the character with the Savior of Life Profession Concentration Skill and the First Aide Skill may place both hands on a Bleeding Out character to simulate 10 seconds of performing emergency First Aide (tunicates, burning wounds shut, etc) on a character to instantly activate First Aide.  By calling Savior of Life while roleplaying a quick patching of wounds, the target of Savior of Life is immediately stabilized.",
  "Bearer of the Banner": "It doesn’t always require a great fighter to lead a people, sometimes it takes one person of strong will who is willing to raise the standard. Use of Bearer of the Banner requires the in-game crafting of a generic item: Banner of (organization). The generic item Banner must have an appropriate Physical Representation of a settlement, faith, gang, Strain, or local organization insignia. The size of the banner matters, as the area of effect of Bearer of the Banner is limited to the line of sight that players have to the physical representation of the item: Banner of (organization). Once per event the user of Bearer of the Banner may spend 20 Mind Points and call ‘By the sight of the Banner, all (organization): (effect)’. All characters that are described by the definition of the organization of the Banner and are in the line of sight (and capable of seeing) the Banner may receive the benefit of one of the following effects. If an affected character leaves line of site of the Banner, or is blinded, the benefits provided by Bearer of the Banner are lost. If the Banner is destroyed, or dropped to the ground, the effects of Bearer of the Banner are lost. Characters may only have the advantage of one use of Bearer of the Banner at a time. {li} Immunity to Fear (Duration 30 minutes) {li} Immunity to Nightmares (Duration 30 minutes) {li} Immunity to Enslavement (Duration 30 minutes) {li} Immunity to Agony (Duration 30 minutes) {p} {li} Example: By the sight of the Banner, all Citizens are Immune to Fear for 30 minutes. {li} Example: By the sight of the Banner, all Mericans are immune to Enslavement for 30 minutes. {li} Example: By the sight of the Banner, all Telling Visions are immune to Agony for 30 minutes.",
  "Bread and Circuses": "Sometimes things are just horrible, and people need to be distracted from their worries. With the use of the Bread and Circuses Profession Concentration skill, a character with the Entertain Skill may perform for at least 30 minutes in front of a crowd. Any individuals that stay for the whole duration of the performance (and activation of the Entertain Skill) can be targeted by Bread and Circuses. {p} Without the Entertain Skill, use of Bread and Circuses requires that all targeted individuals be provided 1 crafted non-mechanic meal and 1 crafted non- mechanic drink. Each individual must have one full serving of both food and drink. {p} Once per event Bread and Circuses may be activated by either the person handing out food and drink or the Entertain with the Bread and Circuses skill, by first providing the food and drink or the performance, and then spending 20 Mind Points. Entertainers that have performed may call ‘By the sound of my performance, regain 5 mind’. An individual handing out food and drink may call ‘By the consumption of food and drink, remove all temporary derangements’. If a performer with the skill Entertain has performed while generic food and drink was consumed by all, then the Entertainer may call ‘By my performance, food, and drink remove all temporary derangements and regain 5 mind.”",
  "Hosting the Gala Event": "Hosting a social event in the time of the post-apocalypse is frustrating to say the least. Figuring out what different combination of cups suggests that you chose each tea serving individually instead of just pulled together what you could, while dealing with the undead beating down your door is hard work. So if a Host can be assured that the guests aren’t going to kill one another, then at least one issue has been taken care of. When Hosting the Gala Event, the Socialite Focus character with this Skill must first set a formal dinner or tea space. Food and beverages, of at least the generic crafted variety, must be provided for all of the guests. Once everyone is sitting at the table, the individual intending on Hosting the Gala Event must spend 5 Mind Points for every guest that is sitting at the table and partaking in the food and drink. The guests sitting that are being hosted (targets of the effect) may choose to expend 5 Mind Points of their own to ‘willingly be a part of the festivities’. If the guest spends the 5 Mind to be a willing member, the individual using Hosting the Gala Event regains the 5 Mind Points they would have spent. Once all targets have been resolved, no individuals at the table may willingly harm themselves or others sitting at the table. This includes all psionic attacks, use of damage causing skills, trigger of traps, or giving commands for others to attack. Once one target of Hosting the Gala Event or the individual using the power takes damage (to armor or body), the effects of Hosting the Gala Event come to an end.",
  "Life of the Party": "Being a socialite host is not only dif cult but is also a great responsibility to ensure the health and safety of those they are hosting. This advantage allows the Socialite Focus character access to the Rover ‘Bond of Salt’ advantage.  In the instance that the character with the Socialite Focus is already a Rover, then the limitation of 10 Health transferal is instead increased to up to a 50 health transferal.",
  "Unwanted Guest": "Ensuring the quality of your party sometimes means having an ‘A List’ and a ‘Nay List’. A character with a Socialite Focus is capable of making anyone feel unwelcomed at an event- so much so that they are unable to remain in the room. Usable on any Strain, once per event a Socialite Focus character may spend 5 minutes loudly degrading and being obviously insulting and catty about an individual. At the end of the 5 minutes of chastising (if Choking Blow or other forms of silencing are used midway, the insult train must begin again) the Socialite Focus character may spend 20 Mind Points to force that individual to leave line of sight of the Socialite Focus character (minimum 50 feet) and not return for one hour. Use of this Skill may not be defended against, delayed, mind resisted, or refused. This Skill only works on living Strains who are capable of removing themselves. In the instance that a target of Unwanted Guest is unable to remove themselves (Mangled limbs, effect of Tied Bonds), the target will suffer under the effect of Choking Blow for 10 minutes as they silently look at the ground in shame.",
  "The Dead Market": "Somewhere between the connections of the Black Market and the Guilds of Murder Inc. and the associated assassin’s guilds is a long-standing network of body part merchants. This network of Grave Robbers, assassins, and black market dealers do not trade in most common currencies, but instead only do business with debts of life or death. Commonly known as ‘Blood Notes’, these difficult to procure currencies are capable of purchasing some of the most hard to find materials and favors. At Check In, a character with this skill may trade in Blood Notes for any of the following items. {li} 2 Blood Note – Gizmo: Little Blue Vial. 6 Month Expiration. Used in conjunction with Grave Robber procedures. {li} 4 Blood Notes – Gizmo: Single Use Tank Heart. 6 Month Expiration. Used in conjunction with Grave Robber procedures. {li} 6 Blood Notes - Honor Hunt: A ‘must kill’ contract is opened on a single individual which will be passed along to Murder Inc. or the local associated Guild Membership. Contract is active at the branch in which the Blood Note is expended. Effects to remove this contract may not be used until at least 2 months after the purchase of an Honor Hunt. {li} Blood Notes – Persona Non Grata: Bribing the local Black Market to compete to make a target’s life miserable, being marked as Persona Non Grata puts any Black Market member who is willing to do business with the target in poor standing with the Black Market. Contests for promotion and rare materials provided to the individual who does the most economic harm to the Persona Non Grata is standard within the Black Market. Being Persona Non Grata may not be removed by any means for at least 2 months after the purchase of Persona Non Grata.",
  "Route Management": "Trade Routes often times require an extensive amount of footwork to locate and keep operational.  With the Route Management Concentration Skill a player that has traveled to a neighboring branch, not their home game, may spend 20 Trade Notes to open a 3 month Route Management (Name of Branch) Trade Route. This Trade Route allows a player to have access to one branch specific named Herb or Scrap via the trade route at a rate of 5 Trade Union Notes per unit of Herb or Scrap, with a maximum of 2 units being able to be purchased per Check In. If the player with the Route Management skill has the Skill Trade Routes, the maximum number of units of Herb or Scrap is increased to 5 per event. Once this Route Management (Name of Branch) card has been produced, it may only be used at the player’s home game as per regular Trade Route use.  A player may only have one Route Management Trade Route linked with each branch at a time.  The trade routes are nontransferable and may not be augmented with Skills or other item effects.",
  "Financial Exchange": "This Skill allows the character with the Financial Exchange skill the ability to purchase Trade Notes at the current listed rate (as per current value list) using their home branches base economy during check in. This Skill also allows players to cash in up to 20 trade notes at a travel event (an event at another branches game) for local currency at the current listed rate (as per current value list)",
  "Extra Mile": "If you are a Brewer, a Tinker, an Engineer, or a Cook there is nothing sadder in the world than seeing something expired before it could be used. The skilled craftsman knows that if you trim the edges, cut away the mold, press the corners, shave off the broken bits, that most of the time you can squeeze a little more life out of resources gone bad. Any character with the Extra Mile skill may spend 30 minutes roleplaying recovering a resource (drying, upkeep, trimming, etc.), and then expend 20 Mind Points and a basic Scrap and basic Herb. Once the roleplay and the expenditure is complete, the player may go to Logistics to have the expiration date of any single Produce, Herb, Scrap, print, weapon, Brew, Meal, armor, shield, shooter, bow, knucks, Gizmo, or engineered enhancement two months beyond the items expiration date (not date of Skill used). This item is then marked as ‘Extended’ on the item card, meaning that Extra Mile may not be used on that item ever again. Use of Extra Mile on crafted resource (meal, armor, shield, shooter, bow, knucks, Gizmo, engineered enhancement) requires that the user have the appropriate crafting skill to have built the item in the first place (Forging the Future for engineered enhancements, etc.).",
  "Make A Show Of It": "As a Brewer, Cook, Distiller, Tinker, or Engineer sometimes there is nothing more boring than the time it takes to craft a complex Meal or Brew; just to have the person who wants it run off without so much as a thank you. For those that suffer for their craft, often times they have found that the time to craft goes faster if there is company to share the work. A character with the Make A Show Of It Skill may spend 10 Mind Points to trigger the ‘Entertain’ Skill (even without having the Skill) on a target character who keeps the crafter company. The user of Make a Show of It must safely augment their roleplay for crafting to be more entertaining and interesting to observe.  If the user of Make A Show Of It already possesses the Entertain Skill, they may activate the Entertain Skill for 1 mind point instead of the standard cost.  Make A Show Of It use does count towards the use of Entertain use limit, however cooking performances are restricted to a minimum of 20 minutes of roleplay to trigger the Entertain Skill. Skills that benefit from this advantage are: Brew Master, Brewing, Building Tomorrow, Forging the Future, Healthy Feast, Prepare Meal, Transcribe, and Weld. This skill does not cut down production time, and any tools or equipment used to augment the production process must be possessed by both crafters involved.",
  "Resourceful Mind": "Often times on of the biggest difficulties a crafter has is finding the prints, recipes, and instructions that the crafter needs to get the job done. Once per event a character with the Resourceful Mind Skill may spend 30 minutes roleplaying in an appropriate location to research and experiment and then spend 20 Mind Points. After spending these Mind Points the player may go to Logistics to collect a single random Blueprint from their appropriate print category. Prints are rolled from randomly in the ‘available to all games’ section of the Blueprint categories. This may produce prints that the skill user already owns, at which point there is no re-roll. {p}Please see the following chart to determine how the Blueprint is chosen: {table:3} Skill Player Has ||| Location Character Must RP In ||| Print Category ||| Brew Master ||| Engineered Still (card required) ||| Brewing Prints ||| Building Tomorrow ||| Engineered Workbench (card required) ||| Forging the Future ||| Tinker Prints ||| Engineered Forge (card required) ||| Engineering Prints ||| Healthy Feast ||| Engineered Kitchen (card required) ||| Cooking Prints ||| Transcribe ||| Engineered Library (card required) ||| Choice of any above",
  "Made to Order": "Allows a crafter to take a Two Handed melee weapon, that is at least Crafts Level 5, and craft that item to become a Pole-Arm grade weapon.  Pole-Arm grade weapons may only be used by characters with the Pole-Arm mastery skill. Production of Made to Order requires a workbench, 30 minutes of role-playing the breaking down and reconstruction of the weapon, and 20 Mind Points. No materials are required to be expended during the use of Made to Order, nor do any other mechanics or expiration dates change for the Two Handed weapon. When done with the expenditure and the roleplay of Made to Order, the original Item Card and Workbench card must be brought to logistics to have a new Item Card produced. This new Item Card duplicates all of the information on the original card, except the word Pole-Arm requirement is added to the mechanics.",
  "Custom Modification": "Allows a crafter to repurpose firearms and bows to create high-end Heavy Ordinance grade weapons. By reworking firing mechanisms, mechanical components, and basic design of a weapon, the crafter can take a firearm of Crafts Level 5 or greater, or a bow of Crafts Level 5 or greater, and produce a ranged weapon that no longer requires bolt action or bow, but instead requires the Heavy Ordinance Skill for use. Custom Modification requires a Workbench, 30 minutes of roleplaying the breaking down and reconstruction of the weapon, and 20 Mind Points. No materials are required to be expended during the use of Custom Modification, nor do any other mechanics or expiration dates change for the  firearm or bow. When done with the expenditure and the roleplay of Made to Order, the original Item Card and Workbench card must be brought to Logistics to have a new item card produced. This new Item Card duplicates all of the information on the original card, except the word Heavy Ordinance is added to the mechanics.",
  "Rushed Job": "Sometimes a customer needs a brew, meal, or engineering enhancement in period of time that is just impossible to pull off. Sometimes crafters are able of doing the impossible. With the Skill Rushed Job, once per event a crafter can expend 10 Mind Points and 5 Health beyond the required production cost of a single crafted item to produce the item in 2 Minutes. The two minutes of roleplay of the use of this Skill should involve a flurry of activity involving the appropriate engineered work area (engineered Kitchen, engineered Transcription table, engineered Still, engineered Forge, or engineered Workbench). Use of this Skill works with the following Skills: Forging the Future, Healthy Feast, Prepare Meal, Building Tomorrow, Transcribe, Brewing, or Brew Master. The transcription, creation, or production of an item via Blueprint MUST have the required Skill listed to be able to use Rushed Job. In the instance that a print does not list one of the prior skills for production, that print may not benefit from Rushed Job. Any print transcription, if possible of being copied, is assumed to using the Transcription skill. At the completion of a Rushed Job, the Kitchen, Forge, Workbench, or Transcription Table/Gizmos used are completely destroyed as they fall apart. The work area may not be repaired, chopped, or salvaged in any way.",
  "Thousand Arms Crafter": "Being able to juggle multiple projects at the same time is a telling sign of a true crafting master. The Thousand Arms Crafter is capable of using multiple crafting Skills at the same time as long as the appropriate tools and supplies are within reach. As long as the required workplace for two forms of crafting are within 10 steps of one another (Forge, Workbench, Still, Kitchen, Drafting table) a character with the appropriate crafting Skills may operate two separate Skills and two separate projects at the same time.  In addition, two uses of the same Skill (as long as there are two of the same required crafting station within 10 paces) may be used at the same time. While this Skill does not lower production time, Mind Point cost, or provide Skills that the character already has, this Skill does allow for greatly reduced time tables by allowing simultaneous use of two of the prior listed Skills at the same time. {p} When using the Thousand Arms Crafter advantage, the crafter must roleplay running back and forth between projects.  Each crafting job is considered separate in regards to time reduction, augments, and effects used. If the crafter activates any other Skills or is damaged while using Thousand Arms Crafter, ALL projects are considered lost.",
  "A Stitch in Time": "Having a systematic and organized system of crafting allows for multiple projects to be completed at the same time. By expending the materials (Scrap, Herb, Gizmos, etc) for 2 of the same product, a crafter with the Stitch in Time Skill may produce two identical items at the same time. While this does not reduce the time required to produce one item, or the number of supplies that needed to be expended to craft both items, or the Mind Points required to craft both items, it does allow for the time to produce 2 identical items to be shared one the same work space. This Skill applies to Brewing, Forging the Future, Building Tomorrow, Healthy Feast, and any Blueprint that requires at least one of these skills. {p} When using A Stitch in Time, the crafter must roleplay running back and forth between projects.  Each crafting job is considered separate in regards to time reduction, augments, and effects used. If the crafter activates any other Skills or is damaged while using A Stitch in Time, ALL projects are considered lost.",
  "Tchotchkes for Miles": "Generic Meals, Generic Crafted items, Generic Room Additions, and GenericFood, while not filling or useful, can make a fortune. Sometimes people are willing to shell out quality currency for the simple pleasures. With the Tchotchkes for Miles Profession Concentration Skill, the bulk crafter can get more miles out of their generic production. Generic Meals and Generic Drinks produced with the Tchotchkes for Miles advantage last 6 months instead of their normal expirations. In addition, when crafting generic Gizmo items, those crafted items are automatically produced at 1 Crafts Level higher than they should be produced, according to the supplies and Mind Points invested into the crafting of the item.",
  "Shroud of Faith": "A Templar with this Skill literally takes the lives of the faithful into their hands, ensuring that others who share their faith do not fall further into the grip of the infection. By spending 10 Mind Points and 5 Health Points, an Apocatastian Templar can raise their hand into the air and declare ‘Shroud of Faith’ along with the name of their religion. All baptized members of their faith within 10 feet immediately pause their Bleed Out count, and do not resume it until the effect is released. During the duration of this effect, the Apocatastian Templar must stand with their hand raised high over their head in a fist, and cannot move, act, or use other Skills, though they may still speak normally.",
  "Guardian of the Order": "A Templar with this Skill is often charged with the task of defending their places of worship, and their unwavering devotion can even inspire their fellow believers to stand strong in the face of mind-numbing horrors. By spending 20 Mind Points while standing within an established place of worship, an Apocatastian Templar can ignore threats that would shake the will of lesser individuals. For the duration of 1 hour all Fear and Terror effects targeting the user of Guardian of the Order immediately fail, as do all such effects used against others members of the faith while in that place of worship.",
  "Pillar of Strength": "A Templar within his place of worship can use prayer to tap into a deep core of spiritual strength, and ultimately don that sanctity like a suit of armor. After spending 10 minutes in deep prayer in their place of worship, the Templar with this skill may expend 20 Mind Points. At the end of the Templar’s prayer, the Templar is gifted with 50 points of radiant spiritual armor for the next hour. This armor is signified by hanging a clearly visible blue glow stick around the torso of the user.",
  "The Lone Guard": "At times personal sacrifice is needed to ensure the safety of others. An Apocatastian Templar with this skill may spend 20 Mind Points and sacrifice all remaining Health Points (minimum of 20 required) while standing in a doorway to their place of worship. For the next hour any healing effects, brews, or powers that bestow Health Points on the Templar instantly fail, and the Templar cannot take a single step. However, during this hour they are immune to all physical and psionic based skills, attacks, and damage. In addition, any Skills that would forcibly move them or otherwise cause the Templar to leave their post immediately fail. At the end of this hour, the Templar begins a 1 minute Bleed Out period; even then, however, they still do not leave their post. Instead they continue to hold their ground while death grips them; they cannot attack but still block the entrance.",
  "Wrath of the Just": "At times temperance is not a valid choice, and truly terrifying wrath must be unleashed upon the enemies of your faith. To activate this Skill, first the Templar must receive a Bless Weapon from a priest of their faith other than themselves. Following this blessing, the Templar may fall to their knees, offer a prayer to their higher power and expend 10 Mind Points and 10 Health Points. The next 3 attacks performed by the Templar do 30 Blessed damage! If these attacks are not used in an hour, they are lost.",
  "Side Kick": "An Avontuur without an assistant is just a junk collector bogged down by equipment. After roleplaying a 30 minute training session, an Avontuur with the Side Kick skill can instruct a willing character with less than 50 earned experience points to become the Avontuurs Side Kick. After the 30 minutes of training and the expenditure of 20 Mind Points by the Avontuur, the trained Side Kick gains the ability to carry at a rate of 2 (as per Iron Slave skill. Iron Slaves increase to a Carry rate of 3) as well as one free use of ‘Bomb Awareness’ and ‘Alert’ per Twelves. Both the increase in Carry as well as the use of Bomb Awareness and Alert may be only used when within 10 paces of the Avontuur that used Side Kick to train them. As long as the Avontuur with Side Kick has an active (living, conscious, and not in Bleed Out) Side Kick within 10 paces, Bomb Awareness and Alert Skill uses cost drop to 1 Mind Point each. Able Assistant lasts until the Side Kick enters Bleed Out, dies, or is released by the Avontuur. Multiple Side Kicks may be used at the same time; however, each Side Kick requires its own 30 minute training session unless the Avontuur has the ‘Instruct’ Skill.",
  "Don't Monologue": "Everyone hates it when a villain or a nemesis just keeps on gloating, talking, and going into a prolonged monologue. If a target has been talking for at least 5 minutes without active back and forth dialog (talking for 5 minutes without response or interaction) then the Avontuur may expend 10 Mind Points to engage the ‘Knockout’ skill with either a thrown weapon or a brawler- without need of striking the target in the back! When using Don’t Monologue the Avontuur must declare ‘Don’t Monologue, Knockout!’ when they strike with their brawler or with the use of a thrown weapon. This Skill may be avoided or parried as per normal thrown weapon or brawling strike; however, regardless if the strike lands or not this Skill disrupts the use of Gilded Daisy.",
  "Dust and Bones": "Once per event an Avontuur can shrug off the effects of being blown up by traps, poisoned by bizarre chemicals, and mauled by wild creatures. If the Avontuur has bled out (not Killing Blown but gone a full 5 minutes into death) the Avontuur with Dust and Bones can lie under the effects of ‘Feign Death’ for 10 minutes. During these 10 minutes any attempts to Killing Blow or use Check Status on the Avontuur fail. After 10 minutes of being ‘dead,’ the Avontuur can slowly get to their feet with 1 point of Health. If during the 10 minutes of post mortem use of Dust and Bones anyone attempts to take the Avontuurs ‘Trademark Item,’ then the Avontuur may immediately get to their feet with 1 point of Health, as long as they focus on getting back their Trademark Item immediately.",
  "Smuggler's Run": "Sometimes getting the prize is not as difficult as getting away with the prize. Smuggler’s Run allows an Avontuur to quickly escape a deadly environment after grabbing the needed prize. Once per event an Avontuur can expend 10 Mind Points to fair escape a NPC LAND MODULE (may not be used in available ‘roleplay’ territory or PVP situations) to escape as long as they have no Mangled legs, are not restrained via Binds, are not in Bleed Out, are not using the Rescue Skill, and have not been Knocked out. Once the 10 Mind Points have been expended, the Avontuur must SPRINT from where they currently are on site back to Logistics to report that they have utilized Smuggler’s Run. If the Marshal or any assigned NPC running the module is able to beat the Avontuur to Logistics, then the Avontuur will return to play stabilized from Bleed Out due to damage taken while escaping. If the Avontuur makes their way back to Logistics before the Marshal or assigned NPC, the Avontuur may enter play at full health. After activating ‘Smuggler’s Run’ the Avontuur must put their OOC gesture up and wait for the Marshal or NPC to be ready to chase. The two running individuals may not engage other PCs nor engage each other in combat/Skill use. During the entire run both the Marshal and the NPC must have OOC headbands on (User of Smuggler’s Run is required to carry two on them). If this Skill is used in periods of unsafe terrain (mud, snow, hurricane, pitch black night) the Marshal on hand may opt to send the Avontuur back with 1/2 their current Health rounded down.",
  "Trademark Item": "The commanding personality of an Avontuur often times results in certain trademark aspects of that individual’s persona. Be it a lucky rabbit’s foot that they always have on them, a special hat, or even a particular piece of jewelry, every good Avontuur has a Trademark image to them. By having a particular creature comfort card, an appropriate Physical Representation of the item in question, and by expending 10 Mind Points, an Avontuur may develop a Trademark item. This item, explained on a unique item card, allows the Avontuur to reduce Charisma time requirements to 2 minutes and ‘Deny’ single uses of ‘torture’ or ‘interrogate’ by expending 5 Mind Points (Deny allows the interrogated to choose to not respond or instead give a witty retort). An Avontuur may only have one Trademark item at a time, and is required to have the item plainly visible to utilize the Charisma or ‘Deny’ skills. Trademark items expire every 6 months; however, the same creature comfort card and Physical Representation may be used again after the 6 month period. If a Trademark item is ever stolen, the individual holding the Trademark item receives the skills ‘Tie Binds’ and ‘Knock Out’ that they may only expend on the Avontuur (standard Mind Point expenditures required).",
  "Last Word": "Nothing pisses off a Bone Breaker more than a weasel who talks their way out of situations. By expending 10 Mind Points and successfully landing a brawling attack on the guilty party, a Bone Breaker may negate the effect of any current uses of Beg for Life, Charisma, Fear, Terror, or Frightening Force applied against them. The Bone Breaker then becomes immune to effects from these Skills for 5 minutes after activating Last Word.",
  "Echoing Pain": "Bone Breakers know how to hurt people, and hurt people bad. Echoing Pain mimics the effects of the Skill Torture, including cost, but with two major changes. When a Bone Breaker uses Echoing Pain, they must use their hands –i.e. brawling boffer attacks, do not actually lay hands on other people!– to assault the target. They cannot use any other weapons or means of inflicting pain, or allow others to do so. At the end of the Torture session, if at least 20 minutes of pain was inflicted, the target receives the temporary derangement of ‘algophobia’ (fear of pain) for the next 2 hours.",
  "Strong Chin": "Bone Breakers not only dish out large amounts of pain, but they have endured equally massive amounts of punishment as well. Accustomed to the abuse of brawling matches, Bone Breakers ignore all brawling damage attacks of 2 or less damage. Note that Skills, poisons or other effects that take effect through damaging strikes are still effective if they hit; only the strike damage itself is nulli ed. If the Bone Breaker is wearing armor, the armor is damaged before Strong Chin begins to work.",
  "Tougher Than Metal": "Bone Breakers often walk into battle without wielding weapons, and with good reason. A Bone Breaker with this Skill does 2 additional points of damage with each brawling strike that they land. In addition, a Bone Breaker with this Skill may expend 5 Mind Points to do a total of 10 damage with a single successful brawling attack.",
  "Ring Out": "Sometimes a fight doesn’t require you to beat an opponent into submission, but instead simply remove them from the combat area. Ring Out allows a Bone Breaker to expend 10 Mind Points and send their target back 20 paces with a successful brawling attack. In addition, the target is stunned, and may only defend themselves for 2 minutes. Zombies who are struck with this skill do not become stunned, but instead suffer 75 damage as half of the zombie goes flying 20 paces. If this is enough damage to down a zombie, they are also considered to have received a Killing Blow.",
  "New Horizons": "An Entrepreneur with this skill understands that what is common in one town may be rare and expensive in another. An Entrepreneur may expend 5 Mind Points to turn any one Basic Scrap or Herb card in for one Rare Scrap or Herb card. One commodity may be exchanged for the other, that is, Scrap for Herb or Herb for Scrap. Each card exchanged this way requires an individual expenditure of Mind Points. This Skill is used before play, but not during Check In - instead, it is used after Opening Announcements, allowing a savvy Entrepreneur to gather an idea of what people might need.",
  "Bankrolling": "You have to spend money to make money they say, and this Skill shows the proof of that. At the start of an event, before entering play, an Entrepreneur may expend 5 Mind Points and risk any number of credits in their possession. (You cannot risk credits you do not have.) After this is done, roll a twenty sided die. On a 1, all of the risked credits were lost in a venture. On 2-9 half of the risked credits were lost on a venture (rounded down). On a 10-19, you gain credits equal to half the amount risked (rounded up). On a 20 the amount of credits gained equals double the amount risked. This skill may only be used once before a particular event, and the die roll must be witnessed by a Staff Member.",
  "Cornered Market": "Having a monopoly on a product is vital in regards to controlling the amount that you can charge for it. With this Skill, you can manipulate caravan  ow and Trade Ties to such a point where by informing Logistics and expending 15 Mind Points, you can specify that a particular Named Scrap, Named Herb, recipe, or Blueprint is no longer available via outside trade. This Skill’s effects last for the duration of one day; a prolonged ‘product draught’ requires continued expenditures. If someone does attempt to gain said items from Logistics through the use of Skills, they will be informed that stock ‘Just ran out’ and that they should check back later.",
  "New Design": "With this Skill, an Entrepreneur has their fingers in so many different pies that they are always the first to learn about new developments in regards to marketable technology. At the start of an event before entering play, an Entrepreneur with this Skill may expend 5 Mind Points to look through 5 random Blueprints at Logistics. The Entrepreneur has the option of purchasing one of the items described in the blueprints, at a credit cost of 50 local currency for the blueprint or item.",
  "Mini-Mall": "The only thing better than making money from selling product is getting other people to sell things that make you money! With this Skill an Entrepreneur may place items they own up for sale and trade not only at their own local market, but also listed in the Black Market as well as in merchant areas outside of town. Mini-Mall costs nothing to activate, however, any item that is placed up for sale will receive bids not only from the players, but also from NPCs who may or may not even enter game. On occasion a Staff Member may approach an Entrepreneur with this Skill with a bid on an item either through the Black Market (where PCs can buy items anonymously) or bids from outside the city. {p} Note: Only items with Item Cards may be used with Mini-Mall.",
  "Atom Smasher": " A Free Radical with this Skill can cause the radiation coursing through their veins to assist them in battle. By expending 5 Mind Points, and taking 1 damage that cannot be blocked by armor, the Free Radical soaks a single weapon with their irradiated blood. For the next hour, this weapon gains the trait ‘Radiation’ and increases its damage by 1. This Skill does not work on bows or  rearms; however, it does work on javelins and thrown weapons. This Skill may not be stacked on a single item, and items with this effect should be marked with small green glow sticks at night (or similar effects).",
  "Evolution": "Free Radicals with this Skill are horrific to most outsiders. If a Free Radical who is not a Retrograde gains this Skill, they begin to suffer from the same physical deformity that Retrogrades suffer from. If the Free Radical is already a Retrograde, their skeletal features become incredibly pronounced, and they must costume or wear makeup accordingly. When Evolution is purchased, painful mutations course through the recipient’s body, and never entirely go away. However, these mutations also grant rapid cellular regeneration; by expending 1 Mind Point, the Free Radical unleashes these energies, instantly (though painfully) repairing any broken or mangled limbs.",
  "Healthy Green Glow": "Free Radicals love their radiation, and one with this skill loves the green stuff even more so. Not only is any damage with the radiation descriptor nullified, the Free Radical regains 1 Health instead of being harmed. (No matter how much damage is nullified, only 1 Health is regained.) This applies to Area of Effect attacks as well as damage specifically directed at the Free Radical. Simply being in areas of high radiation does not heal Free Radicals, as the radiation effect must actively declare damage. This Skill does not work on targets that are already in Bleed Out. To use Healthy Green Glow the Free Radical must at least be at 1 Health.",
  "Jacob's Broken Ladder": "A Free Radical has begun to alter their genetic structure at a cellular level, to such a degree that they nearly appear to become their own separate Strain. When this skill is learned, the Free Radical with this Skill emits a warm green glow when they sleep at night. This glow must be represented by the use of green lights or glow sticks when the Skill owner actually out-of-character sleeps. Any person who attacks an individual with Jacob’s Broken Ladder while they sleep resolves their attack normally; however, a radioactive cloud is immediately released into the room, in icting 20 Radiation Damage to everyone in the room. (Bomb Awareness allows an individual to avoid this damage, assuming they were not the one who landed the strike.) This damage also causes the illness ‘Radiation Poisoning’ to any who suffer damage from this effect.",
  "Share the Love": "By far the most disturbing capability of a Free Radical, this Skill is the ultimate expression of their unstable nature. A Free Radical with this skill may reset their genome with the expenditure of 20 Mind Points and 4 hours of roleplaying this intensely painful, transformative experience. This Skill cannot be used without notifying the game staff one event in advance, and may require extensive work prior to its use, due to the fact that it allows a Free Radical to permanently rewrite their genetic structure. In game terms, this means that they may either become a member of an existing Strain other than their own, or even to create a new Strain. Creation of a new Strain results in a custom ‘unique Item Card’ which must be carried on the character at all times to explain the advantages and disadvantages of the new Strain. The mechanics of the new Strain must first be approved by both local branch AND network before being allowed to enter play. Use of this Skill causes the loss of the Free Radical Advanced Profession and all Skills associated with the Free Radical profession. In addition, if the character purchased a Skill from their original Strain list that their new Strain list does not have and that is not available through their other lists, that Skill is also lost. For example, if a Retrograde purchased Cover of Night from their Strain list, but neither their existing professions nor their new Strain list receives that Skill, it is immediately lost. Acquiring an existing Strain simply requires alerting the game staff as normal. By contrast, the creation of a new Strain must receive written approval by the staff prior to the use of this skill, as crafting a new Strain requires extensive work with the staff in order to ensure that they are balanced, interesting and in keeping with the tone and flavor of the game. New Strains created this way will have advantages, disadvantages and Skill lists dictated by the staff - while the player may certainly contribute ideas and suggestions as part of this process, in the end the final say regarding new Strains is in the hands of the senior Staff Member. Only when all the details are finalized in writing and approved by senior staff will a new Strain be approved and this Skill ready for play.",
  "Arrest Warrant": "When a G-Man sets their sights on a target, very little can keep them from bringing that fugitive in. To use this skill, the G-Man must first receive or compile a file on their target, listing everything they know and preferably whatever else they can uncover through interviewing witnesses, victims, known associates and the like. Other details such as sketches, fingerprints, etc., are encouraged but not required. The target must be at least under suspicion of a crime worthy of the G-Man’s offucial notice – murder, slaving (in certain areas), terrorism, guild membership, black market membership, theft of vital national secrets – or be the subject of a special request for assistance by local law enforcement. After that, the G-Man must study this file for a minimum of one hour and draw up an arrest warrant naming the subject and their alleged crimes as well as spend 15 Mind Points. An agent may only have one Arrest Warrant active a time; if they choose to change their target, the first warrant immediately expires. For one full day afterward, when confronting the target of their Arrest Warrant, the G-Man may declare “Arrest Warrant! Negate!” to negate the following skills: Cover of Night, Disguise, Escape, Fade In A Crowd, Vanish, or Whisper Walk. In addition, while directly pursuing the target of the Arrest Warrant, the G-Man may spend 10 Mind Points to temporarily delay the effects of Nail, Slowed Steps, Body Lock, Mangle Limb attacks to the legs or other movement impairing effects for five minutes. Each effect must be delayed separately, and an effect may only be delayed once with this skill. Numerical damage and effects that do not directly impair movement are not affected. Skills and other defenses cannot be called against the delayed effects.",
  "Bound By Law": "Catching criminals doesn’t matter much if you can’t hold onto them, and cases can’t be made if evidence goes missing or forgeries are slipped into evidence. Once a G-Man learns this Skill they have been trained in pre-Fall practices of securing and improving locking mechanisms to prevent witnesses from being murdered or locked boxes from being opened. A G-Man may spend at least 10 Mind Points to place an of cial “Bound By Law” notice on an in-game crafted lock, which doubles the Crafts Level of the lock for three days. Multiple uses of Bound by Law may be expended on the same lock, each doubling the improved Crafts Level of the lock. As an example a Crafts 5 lock becomes a Crafts 10 lock on the first application of Bound By Law and then becomes a Crafts 20 lock on the second application of Bound By Law. If a Shade wishes to access a secured room using Lurking Threat, they must spend as many Mind Points as were spent on Bound By Law to do so, in addition to the normal cost of the Skill. {p} Last but not least, the G-Man may spend 10 Mind Points and declare that a target already subjected to Tie Binds is now Bound By Law. Removing the binds from this target now requires a full 10 minutes of roleplaying freeing them or destroying their bonds. The G-Man does not need to be the one who placed the Tie Binds skill on the target.",
  "Forensic Rituals": "When it comes to catching criminals, most sheriffs rely on three solutions: wringing a confession out of a suspected criminal, finding an eyewitness to tell the tale, or catching the crook in the act. However, many G-Men learn some of the ancient rituals of their investigative forbears and have access to tools most lawmen can only dream about, allowing them to return to the scene of a crime and  nd crucial evidence days after the occurrence of a crime. After traveling to the scene of a crime and spending a minimum of 1 hour going over it with forensic tools such as magnifying glasses, plaster molds, fingerprint powder, tweezers and the like, as well as sketching it or staging re-creations of the crime, the G-Man may travel to Logistics to “examine their findings” and ask a Storyteller up to two questions about a crime that has taken place. Forensic tools such as a magnifying glass, plaster mold kit, and tweezers may be created with the generic crafting rules. Each question costs 10 Mind Points, and does not receive a direct answer as such, but rather generates a special item card representing physical evidence collected in relation to this question. (These item cards have no value and cannot be used as crafting materials or creature comforts, but are revealed to be genuine if examined by the relevant skills.) Questions must be able to be reasonably answered by physical forensic evidence – a G-Man might be able to judge that a killer was enraged by the presence of massive blood splatter on the walls, for instance, but probably not that the killer was enraged over the theft of a land deed by the victim’s great-grandfather. (When in doubt, think means more than motive- this skill is good at who, what, where and when, but not really why.) Ultimately the Staff Member is the final arbiter of what is allowed, but should remember the technological limitations of the period even for the G-Men and interpret these guidelines narrowly in order to avoid making this Skill seem totally omniscient. For example, a dedicated G-Man goes to a murder scene, roleplays the forensic rituals and spends 20 Mind Points to ask 2 questions. For the first question, she asks “What was the murder weapon?” and receives an Item Card for “spent shotgun shells,” which she found at the scene. For her next question, she asks, “Was anyone here other than the killer and the victim” and receives a card “plaster cast of one set of tracks, found near shotgun shells.” She now knows the killer used a shotgun and apparently acted alone. {p} This skill offers a rare chance to gather concrete physical evidence of a crime that has been committed, but it must be monitored closely to ensure that the questions are appropriate to the investigative methods and the limits of the available technology. Relatively simple evidence collection such as blood, fingerprints, plaster casts, simple trace evidence and the like are fine, but sophisticated tools like DNA evidence, electron microscopes and gas chromatography are right out. Likewise, the Storyteller may limit the number of possible questions asked if the crime occurred a very long time ago or took place in a heavily traveled area, representing how the available evidence has been lost over time.",
  "The Oath": "Before they do anything else, all G-Men take a solemn oath to serve the Federally Bonded Inquisition. Coming as it does at the end of an intense period of training and indoctrination, this commitment gives them a powerful ability to resist temptation, intimidation and even some forms of psionic manipulation. Once this skill is learned, the agent becomes immune to all fear and terror effects, as well as Memory Lapse. In addition, the cost to use Mind Resistance is cut in half. Once a G-Man has taken The Oath, they are required to recite the following abridged version every morning before they start their day and every night when they  nish their days work: “I solemnly swear to uphold the code of the Federally Bonded Inquisition, though it cost me my life.”",
  "Trained Inquisitor": "When G-Men are called in to investigate a case, even hardened criminals find it dif cult to conceal the truth. Any time a survivor attempts to use the Lie or Trickster Mind skill in their presence, the G-Man may spend 20 Mind Points and declare “Trained Inquisitor, Lie Negated.” The target must then tell the truth – they cannot attempt to lie again regarding that question. In addition, the G-Man and any others present are aware the target attempted to lie, and may react accordingly. Alternately, the G-Man may spend 20 Mind Points to declare “Trained Inquisitor, Negate Mind Resistance” to cancel a target’s use of Mind Resistance to avoid answering a question under Torture. Note that the G-Man does not have to be the one using Torture or Interrogate on a target, merely be present while it is taking place.",
  "Eternal Forge": "Gear Heads almost never have the advantage of having somewhere to stop to do their repairs, so Gear Heads have become masters of doing repairs on the fly with makeshift parts and making do with damn near broken equipment. After pulling together a suitable roleplay space of 10 feet by 10 feet with appropriate makeshift tools and props; a Gear Head may expend 10 Mind Points to create a Basic Forge, Workbench, or Still that will last until the next 12s. This Forge must have no less than 6 pieces of automobile memorabilia in it to work, and a Gear Head with the Eternal Forge Skill must be within line of site of the created work space for that work space to function (even if asleep). When activating this Skill the Gear Head with the Eternal Forge must report to Logistics for a short term Gizmo card to represent their work space.",
  "Internal Hearth": "Gear Heads are a tight community of thrill seekers and nomads, and with that in mind, it is not uncommon for them to close ranks against outsiders when one of their own is threatened. Once per event a Gear Head with the Internal Hearth advanced Skill may call on fellow friends of the road for a few hours of help. When activated the Gear Head with the Internal Hearth advancement must spend 20 Mind Points and register that they are calling for help at Logistics. One hour after the Skill is activated (regardless if the player is ready or not) the Gear Head using Internal Hearth must report to Logistics to register that their character is out on the road working connections for 4 hours. During the 4 hour period that the character is out of play the Gear Head using Internal Hearth is required to perform a standard 4 hour NPC shift with no Assistance Points benefit. This NPC shift cannot be the player’s standard NPC shift, and must be an additional full shift. Once the NPC shift is done, the character using Internal Hearth may use the following skills as if they have just checked into game: Deep Pockets, Trade Ties, or Bankrolling. In addition, any current Trade Tie cards that must be used at Check In may be used at this time. Internal Hearth may only be used once per event.",
  "Hotrod Junkie": "There is a passion that burns deep within a Gear Head that can only be sated with fast cars, big engines, and dangerous terrain. It is common place for Gear Heads to race each other for credits or car parts. At check in a Gear Head with the Hotrod Junkie advanced Skill can choose to race for credits or Scrap, and wager anywhere between 1-20 credits, 1-20 Basic Scrap, 1-10 Uncommon Scrap, or 1-5 Rare Scrap. The racer then rolls 1d10 against the Check In Marshal 3 times. If the player wins 2 out of 3 rolls (rolling higher, player loses on a tie) than the risked bet is doubled. If the player loses 2 out of 3 rolls, the risked bet is lost. If the player loses 3 out of 3 rolls, the player owes a debt for vehicle repairs equal to 1/2 of the bet rounded down... and may not use Hotrod Junkie again until that debt is paid. If a debt goes two months unpaid, NPC collectors may come to collect the debt forcibly.",
  "The Outside Chance": "Some say that if you travel far enough, fast enough, that you can actually outrun your problems. The truth of the matter is that you can never outrun your problems as long as you stop at some point. Most Gear Heads prefer to stay on the road, never touching down in a place longer than a few days before hitting the trail again. The Gear Head that has learned The Outside Chance has a nose for trouble, and can tell when the noose is about to be dropped over there head. By spending 20 Mind Points and 4 Rare Scrap a Gear Head with The Outside Chance may spend 20 minutes role playing setting up a dummy in their sleeping area. The Gear Head with The Outside Chance must then go to Logistics and receive a Gizmo card for ‘a trapped dummy’ which will do 50 fire damage to a 20 foot radius if attacked. When the player goes to sleep, if they are attacked while sleeping, instead of fighting back the player simply shows the Gizmo card and declares the damage to everyone in the area. Each Gizmo card will be dated for 1 days use, and will not be provided unless the required Scrap and expenditure has been registered on the back of a the character sheet as well as signed by a Staff Member in Logistics. The character that used The Outside Chance must then put on a OOC headband, and may return to sleep. This Skill may only be used just prior to the PC actually going to sleep, may not be moved once it is set, and may only be used once per an event.",
  "Servant of Iron": "With an understanding of complex motor use, a Gear Head has the ability to perform feats of mechanical enhancement that most people see as nothing short of magic. By expending 20 Mind Points and spending 30 minutes role playing crafting at either a workbench or a forge, a Gear Head with the Servant of Iron can perform any of the following mechanical enhancements: {p} {table:3} Name ||| Cost ||| Effect ||| Hotrod Lead Thrower ||| Scrap: Go Fast Motor x4 Crafts 5 Firearm ||| Firearm becomes a Hotrod Lead Thrower and gains a 6 month expiration date.

Still can only be used to make crafts 5+ master brewed brews. 6 Cylinder Still allows for master crafted brews to allow for up to 16 Mind Points to be expended into Brew Master instead of the normal cap of 10. ||| Auto Shop ||| Scrap: Chrome x1 Scrap: Pointy Tools x1 Scrap: Go Fast Motor x1 Gizmo: Glue x1 Basic Forge ||| Basic Forge becomes an Auto Shop and Gains a 6 month expiration date. Auto Shop (10 ftx 10 ft space, unable to be moved) allows all forged items to have an additional 2 months added to projects forged in the Auto shop with the Expenditure of Named Scrap Chrome x1 per project. All projects made this way have the words ‘Chrome Plated’ added before the name of the engineer project. ||| Big Daddies Fixit Kit ||| Scrap: Chrome x2 Scrap: Pointy Tools x2 Scrap: Go Fast Motor x1 Basic Workbench ||| Basic Workbench becomes a Big Daddy Fixit kit and gains a 6 month expiration date. Big Daddies Fixit Kit requires a portable folding at least 3ftx2ftx2ft metal tool box. This tool box works as a basic workbench however has a carry rate of zero. In addition, all uses of Improve or Repair skills require  standard Mind Points (rounded down) to perform with the expenditure of Named Scrap: Chrome x1. All items repaired this way have the description ‘Chrome Plated’ added before the items description and have their value increased by 5 after the  rst time they become Chrome Plated.",
  "Trinkets of the Past": "Grave Robbers understand that the most important thing that can be recovered from the dead is the knowledge and skills they once had. A Grave Robber may take a recently deceased corpse, still within one week of suffering  nal termination, and learn the secrets and Skills that this body once possessed. After 1 hour of roleplaying vivisecting a zombie, a Grave Robber may spend 10 Mind Points and register the action with Logistics. At that point Logistics will review the sheet of the deceased and inform the Grave Robber what Skills and Professions the deceased possessed. The Grave Robber may then spend Experience Points as if the corpse had acted as a teacher. Standard teaching restrictions apply.",
  "Replacement Parts": "Given their resistant nature, the infected dead often produce some of the best harvests for body parts. In particular, a trade secret of Grave Robbers is that the spinal fluid of the deceased sometimes contains small amounts of a glowing blue liquid. If a Grave Robber has access to a deceased humanoid that has not been harvested, they may spend 10 minutes and 5 Mind Points attempting to extract this substance from a corpse’s spine. After harvesting an undead, the Grave Robber may go to Logistics where they have a 33% chance of harvesting liquid from low-level threats and up to a 66% chance for high level threats. If the harvesting is successful a Gizmo card for ‘Glowing Blue Liquid’ is given. The liquid is not only important in many rare brews, but also can be injected to alter the subject’s metabolism, drastically slowing the bleeding process. Once injected the substance is completely used, and for the duration of 1 hour, the recipient of the injection takes 20 minutes to Bleed Out instead of 5 minutes.",
  "Gene Splicer": "Medical ability only can go so far... until new boundaries must be crossed. Gene Splicer allows a Grave Robber to experiment beyond the realm of standard science and create unique medical procedures. Each procedure must be purchased individually at 5 Experience Points each. A Gene Splicer may also create a new procedure in between events at the cost of 5 Experience Points (new procedures subject to branch and network approval before entering play): {p} {table:2} Procedure ||| Mechanic ||| Lung Expansion ||| Spend 10 Mind Points and 30 minutes operating on a willing subject; target becomes immune to airborne toxins until the next Twelves. ||| Thick Skin ||| Spend 10 Mind Points and 30 minutes operating on a willing subject; target gains 20 Armor points of armored skin until the next Twelves. ||| Eau De Zombie ||| Spend 10 Mind Points and 30 minutes operating on a willing subject; target gains one use of ‘Repulse’ against undead. When announced, all undead must stay at least 10 paces away as long as the user has their hand in the air. If not used by the next Twelves, the benefit is lost. ||| Ice Veins ||| Spend 10 Mind Points and 30 minutes operating on a willing subject; target gains immunity to poisons until the next Twelves. ||| Infectus Mordus ||| Spend 10 Mind Points and 1 Hour working a target through their own personal psycho-reactant hell. Process requires unique item: Glowing Tank Heart and requires 1 month preparation before the process can be done. (Staff must be notified 1 month in advance.) Process may only be done to an individual once every twelve months. If successful, Infectus Mordus will return a point of Infection Rate to the target. The player receiving the advantage of Infectus Mordus (regaining an Infection) must have this procedure done at their home game with the permission of their home games director prior to use of Infectus Mordus.",
  "Last Dance": "A Grave Robber is not named for the actions they take harvesting bodies, but instead by application of this amazing skill. A Grave Robber with this Skill may expend 20 Mind Points and 10 minutes applying medical procedures over the body of someone who has reached final death within the past 3 hours. If the Grave Robber activates the Last Dance, the deceased returns to life, but only for the next 24 hours. After the 24 hours pass or another death occurs, the animated person falls, never able to be revived again. This person will not rise as any form of zombie, and instead will return to the natural cycle of life and death.",
  "Bullet Dodger": "By expending 10 Mind Points, a Marksman is immune to all non-psionic ranged attacks for 5 minutes. This includes Sniped Shots and Scatter Shots, even advanced Skills such as Vital Fire.",
  "Gun-Fu": "This Skill makes traditional Martial Artists shake their heads; however, it is indisputably impressive on the field of battle. With the purchase of this Skill, an additional profession slot opens for a Marksman that may only be used to gain the profession ‘Martial Artist’. Gun-Fu overrides any Strain restriction that would normally prevent a Marksman from being able to learn the Martial Artist profession. Gun-Fu allows a Marksman to learn and use Skills from the Martial Artist profession; however, instead of using your hands you use boffer safe representations of your firearms to deliver these strikes. The brawling skill of Iron Fists cannot be applied to firearms in regards to swinging boffer safe firearm representations as your ‘beaters’. This Skill may not be used unless the Marksman is currently wielding a firearm of at least Crafts Level 5.",
  "Magic Bullet": "A Marksman with this talent is a sniper without equal, able to not only fire accurately but discretely. They may expend 5 Mind Points to make a single ranged firearms attack that does not cause them to break stealth Skills such as Cover of Night, Fade in a Crowd, or Vanish. In addition, this Skill obscures what direction a shot came from, preventing others from homing in on their position by following the sound of the shot (marshal may be required to run Snipe Shot Skill call, please be sure to inform marshals before intending to use this Skill). This Skill may only be used once every 5 minutes. This Skill may not be used unless the Marksman is currently wielding a firearm of at least crafts level 5.",
  "Ricochet": "Incoming fire isn’t nearly as scary when you know how to work the angles to your advantage. By declaring ‘RICOCHET!’ and spending 10 Mind Points, a Marksman with a bolt action weapon in hand can reflect one non-psionic ranged attack back at is user as a Sniped Shot. This projectile must have passed within a 180 degree line of sight arc of the Marksman. This reflected shot is considered to not only have been blocked, but all effects tied to the attack are then applied to the initial attacker. (The new target may use defensive Skills as normal.) For example, if the original shot had ‘Concentrated Fire, Weapon! Destroy Weapon!’ added onto it, then the Richochet will still carry those effects along with the Sniped Shot accuracy. This Skill may not be used to reflect non- ballistic ranged attacks, Area of Effect attacks or melee attacks. This Skill may not be used unless the Marksman is currently wielding a firearm of at least crafts level 5.",
  "Vital Fire": "Fields of fire are great, but a true Marksman only needs one well-placed bullet to get the job done. This skill allows a Marksman to expend 10 Mind Points and make a single, devastating ranged attack that inflicts 50 Damage. Vital Fire may be linked to other legal skills with appropriate expenditures, such as Sniped Shot. However, this skill may only be used once per twelves. This shot may be avoided with Skills that allow for the deflection or avoidance of other ranged attacks, so make sure you save this shot for when it counts! This Skill may not be used unless the Marksman is currently wielding a firearm of at least Crafts Level 5.",
  "Dispatch": "By the time someone has become a successful Mercenary, chances are that they have killed thousands of zombies. Mercenaries can kill zombies in their sleep- sometimes literally. By expending 10 Mind Points, a Mercenary with this skill can call ‘Dispatch’ on a single undead target within two paces. No other effort is required; simply point and declare this Skill’s use. This attack simultaneously inflicts 100 points of unavoidable damage to a single undead target as well as activates the Double Tap Skill.",
  "Hired Muscle": "What is better than one incredibly well-trained Mercenary? How about two or three of them? This Skill costs 10 Mind Points to activate, and allows the user to travel to Logistics and declare that they are outsourcing some Hired Muscle. The user of this Skill will then be given three price options for hiring NPC assistance. For 20 credits, an experienced combatant will help you for one hour. For 40 credits, an experienced mercenary will come to help for an hour. For 60 credits, a hired legend will come to assist you for an hour... a legend that has at least maxed out Mercenary and perhaps has touched on a second Advanced Profession. Soldiers hired through this Skill will follow simple directions, but will not simply charge off to their deaths. At times, due to story reasons, Hired Muscle may not be available or may take more time to arrive. If Hired Muscle is not available, then the 10 Mind Point expenditure is refunded.",
  "In the Zone": "Mercenaries do one thing incredibly well, namely provide excessive violence as a solution to problems. Mercenaries kill so well, in fact, that other fighters around them perform better when they follow their lead. A Mercenary with this Skill may expend 10 Mind Points and name two ‘Battle Buddies’ who each must have less than 6 months of play. (Ask how many months someone has been in town.) As long as these two are each within five feet of the Mercenary, all three members gain the following advantages for up to one hour: 10 minute Bleed Out period instead of the standard 5 minute, all melee damage swung by ‘Battle Buddies’ increased by 2 Damage, and all damage received by those In The Zone is reduced by 2. This Skill may not be stacked multiple times on the same target, and a Mercenary using this Skill multiple times still only receives a single bonus to damage reduction, Bleed Out time, and melee damage.",
  "Interceptor": "Melee combat is one of the most reliable means of martial interaction, however surviving until you reach melee range is the difficult part. With this skill a Mercenary with a melee weapon in hand can spend 5 Mind Points and declare ‘INTERCEPTOR!’ This immediately reflects one non-psionic ranged attack whose projectile has passed within arm’s reach of the Mercenary, back at its user as a Sniped Shot. This reflected shot is considered to not only have been blocked, but all effects tied to the attack are then applied to the initial attacker. (The new target may use defensive Skills as normal.) For example, if the original shot had ‘Concentrated Fire, Weapon! Disarming Shot!’ added onto it, then the Interceptor will still carry those effects along with Sniped Shot accuracy. This Skill may not be used to intercept Murder Most Foul, psionic attacks, or non-ballistic ranged attacks such as Area of Effect attacks.",
  "Training Ground": "Those who kill for a living live a difficult lifestyle, and so work constantly to toughen themselves up enough to survive the next challenge. This Skill may be purchased up to five times, and for each time it is purchased, the Mercenary gains 15 permanent Health Points instead of the standard 10 that would be gained at the same cost.",
  "Rebel Yell": "Sometimes people just need a little encouragement to get a move on. The user of this Skill may expend 20 Mind Points and let out a loud rallying cry. Any non-Red Star ally who hears the Rebel Yell receives 10 points of Armor, heals 10 Health Points, and is immune to Fear and Terror effects for the duration of the next hour. If an ally is currently Bleeding Out, they immediately return to 10 Health Points and can get to their feet. Rebel Yell effects do not stack, and targets may only receive the benefits of one Rebel Yell once a 12s. When possible, it is recommended to talk over this Skill and its benefits with allies in advance, in order to minimize confusion and maximize its effectiveness in the field.",
  "Cheeseburger and a Six Pack": "A Merican Ba-Das is a unique creature, fueled by bizarre combinations of food and drink. A Merican Ba-Das can consume any one twelve ounce brewed potion and expend 10 Mind Points. The Merican Ba-Das that does so regains 20 Health Points and ignores the effects of the brewed substance. This declaration must occur before substance is consumed. If the player of a Merican Ba-Das actually chugs a twelve ounce liquid –water recommended, don’t hurt yourself and then follows the consumption with either a witty phrase or a subsequent machismo act, such as crushing the can against their forehead, then the Merican Ba-Das may instead regain 25 Health Points and ignore the effect of the brewed substance.",
  "Hail of Bullets": "Bullets are little chunks of flying death that really ruin your day, but the Merican Ba-Das simply denies that something so small could cause such big problems. By expending 20 Mind Points, and spending 10 minutes focusing on how heroic the Merican Ba-Das is about to be, the user can activate Hail of Bullets. For 1 hour, the first 10 projectiles that hit the user are considered misses. When a successful projectile hit is nullified with this Skill, the user must loudly declare “Hail No!” This Skill can be used to nullify Sniped Shots and other effects which remove the need for a packet to be thrown. Hail of Bullets may be bestowed to another person as long as A) that person sits and listens to at least a 10 minute pep talk or ‘plan’ from the Merican Ba-Das and B) the target is not a Red Star. Each extra target receiving this Skill’s benefits requires an additional 10 Mind Points.",
  "Walk It Off": "Sometimes a Merican Ba-Das is too proud to fall down or admit something hurts. By expending 5 Mind Points a Merican Ba-Das can ignore the effects of a Mangled limb for 10 minutes. The limb is still broken, as Walk It Off does not repair or negate the limb mangling effect, and after 10 minutes will again become useless again. This Skill may be activated multiple times in a row to extend use of a limb, and may be activated multiple times to ignore multiple broken limbs.",
  "Dumb Luck": "Ba-Das’s are great at opening up worlds of hurt and doing incredibly brave (read: dumb) things, but with all that machismo, the finer mental skills often drop to the wayside. Fortunately Merican Ba-Das’s tend to benefit from more than their share of dumb luck. If the SCIENCE! Skill is available for use, a Merican Ba-Das may spend 2 times the listed SCIENCE! Mind Point cost to receive the benefit of the Skill for that particular instance or invention. While this activation doesn’t mean the Ba-Das completely understands what is going on, it does allow them to get a ‘hunch’ which allows them to act on the information learned through the SCIENCE! Skill. (Needless to say, this skill often infuriates Tinkers, Engineers, Mad Scientists, and other actual educated professions.) In addition, a Ba-Das may spend 10 Mind Points to activate this Skill and become immune to psionic assaults for 5 minutes once and for all proving matter over mind.",
  "Psionic Dissidence": "The Mind Killer is a person who has achieved a massive resistance to the subconscious psionic control that exists in the fungal infection of the Grave Mind. By tapping into the psionic network as a whole, the Mind Killer can cause excruciating pain to psionic beings. To activate Psionic Dissidence, a Mind Killer must take any of the following Gizmos in their hand: Flawed Bloodied Crystal, Flawed Hardened Crystal, Flawed Irradiated Crystal, Flawed Psionic Crystal, Flawed Warm Crystal, Perfect Bloodied Crystal, Perfect Hardened Crystal, Perfect Irradiated Crystal, Perfect Psionic Crystal, or Perfect Warm Crystal. The Mind Killer spends 10 Mind Points and the Gizmo in their hand is destroyed. At which point the Mind Killer may immediately engage in a ranged attack and call “Sniped Shot, Concentrated Fire HEAD - 30 Psion Bane”. This skill is treated as a thrown weapon for defensive purposes.",
  "Burning Call": "The Mind Killer has learned to turn a Psion’s Power against them. By engaging a brawling strike (Knucks may be used) and spending 10 Mind Points, the Mind Killer may call ‘Burning Call: Psion Absorb 30 Mind’. Burning Call may be parried or blocked like any other strike; however, if the strike connects then the Psion taking the hit loses 30 Mind Points as if mind and body where swapped. Use of this power on the Grave Mind often results in both the user and the target taking equal damage (with additional retribution from the Grave Mind). Mind Killers should consider the potential body levels of the Grave Mind verses their own body before attempting this.",
  "Fearless is the Still Mind": "Through extensive training the Mind Killer can learn to push away the in uences of the Psion. Whenever a Mind Killer with Fearless is the Still Mind uses Mind Resistance, they may declare ‘Fearless is the Still Mind’ instead of ‘Mind Resistance’, making each use of the Mind Resistance Skill cause 10 minutes of being immune to Psionic Skills or effects. When struck with psionic attacks after activating ‘Fearless is the Still Mind’, the character using this advanced Skill must say ‘No Effect, Still Mind’ as a response.",
  "The Culling Wall": "If the user of this Skill possesses the Skill ‘Bless Weapon’, they may apply the effects of Culling Wall to the melee weapons and Knucks of others. By spending 5 minutes focusing their strength of will, a Mind Killer with the Culling Wall skill may spend 10 Mind Points to cause a blade to swing ‘Psion Bane’ damage. The effects of Psion Bane supersede any prior damage modifiers or effects that were applied to the weapon, and these effects last 30 minutes. Use of ‘The Culling Wall’ should be recorded on the sheet of the character using Culling Wall as well as the individual wielding the weapon.",
  "One True Reality": "At times creatures such as Toy Boxes and Psionic beings cause altered realities around them that draw others in. A Mind Killer, if aware, may bring these delusions to an abrupt end. If a Mind Killer believes that reality is being subverted around them, they may close their eyes and remain motionless for 5 minutes. At the end of the 5 minutes, if they have not been interrupted, the Mind Killer may spend 20 Mind Points and call ‘One True Reality: By My Voice All Psionic Powers End’. At this point all ongoing psionic powers come to an abrupt end (this includes effects like Tranquility, Whisper Walk, Psychic Armor, and Berserkers Mind).",
  "Hundred Fist Strike": "A practiced Monk has the capacity to achieve great things with very little effort. My focusing their faith into a single hand strike, a Monk may cause great damage to an undead target. By expending 10 Mind Points, the user of this Skill may make a single brawling strike against an undead and declare ‘Hundred Fist Strike’. If this strike connects, this strike considered is a  urry of ten attacks with each strike in icting 10 points of Blessed damage. (While it might seem odd to phrase it this way, it is not the same as a single 100 point strike, as each attack may have damage reduction or other defenses applied against it individually.) This strike does not work against living creatures, as those that are living can still be redeemed, no matter how far they might have fallen.",
  "Flesh of Iron": "Monks feel no need to hide behind armor, nor do they place their faith in shields to de ect projectiles. The only armor that a Monk needs is their faith, and their only shield is their doctrine. A Monk with this skill cannot wear armor of any kind, nor can they carry a shield, but while they walk with an icon of their faith visible - minimum size of three inches by three inches - they reduce damage from any unblessed attacks by 3. This damage reduction also negates effects from modi ers (such as poison or radiation) if the damage is reduced to 0. If that damage is reduced to zero, the user of this skill must announce ‘No Effect’ whenever strikes cause 0 points of damage. Flesh of Iron works against psionic damage as well.",
  "Silent Introspection": "Much like those born to the Nation of Accensor, a Monk finds both physical recovery and renewal of purpose in their prayers. Use of this skill allows a Monk to regain 5 Mind Points and 5 Health Points for every 30 minutes in active prayer. If the Monk is already a member of the Nation of Accensor, they instead recover 10 Health Points, 5 Mind Points, and are cured of all diseases they are currently suffering.",
  "Shatter Strike": "It is a truth known to all Monks that behind shields and armor, you will find a child who is scared. With the expenditure of 20 Mind Points, and by connecting with a single brawling strike, a Monk with this skill may declare ‘Shatter Strike.’ Shatter Strike inflicts 5 sequential Break Armors to a single target. (A target may use defensive capabilities, but each use of Break Armor must blocked individually.) If that the armor was of very high quality (Crafts Level 5 or above), each break lowers the Crafts Level by 1 point and then breaks said item. Example: Crafts Level 7 armor is hit with Shatter Strike. The armor drops immediately to Crafts Level 2 armor and is broken.",
  "Air Strike": "Legends are told of those who have achieved such a degree of focus, they are able to knock projectiles out of the air with their bare hands. A Monk who has mastered the technique of Air Strike is one of these legendary souls. When they or someone within a pace of them is struck with a projectile, including Skill powered shots, the Monk may expend 5 Mind Points and declare ‘Air Strike’ to negate a single ranged attack.",
  "Mob Mentality": "While a mob doesn’t exactly provide ‘justice’ most of the time, it can be an effective means to get things done. By stirring a mob with a rabble-rousing speech that is at least 10 minutes in length, a Mountebank can expend 10 Mind Points to bestow 5 Armor points to each person joining the Mountebank on a single linear adventure. This benefit lasts for either 1 module or 2 hours, whichever comes first. The Mountebank, in exchange, receives 2 Armor points for each person that follows the Mountebank’s lead on this journey (up to 20 followers).",
  "Broken Mirrors": "Sometimes there isn’t enough room in town for two hucksters, and a fight between alpha wolves is never pretty. At Check In, a Mountebank with this skill that signs in before their target may immediately expend 20 Mind Points. (If the target has already checked in before the Mountebank, this skill cannot be used against them that month.) These Mind Points represent the smear campaign and rumor mongering that an expert Mountebank is capable of, preventing the target from benefitting from any Income skill levels. In addition, a green light is placed on this target at the Black Market, offering top dollar for any items taken from the target. This effect lasts 1 month, and must be reactivated again at the next event.",
  "Gilded Daisy": "A flower, no matter how sweet smelling, grows best in manure. The same is true with regard to the Mountebank. By expending 20 Mind Points, a Mountebank with this Skill can avoid being targeted by aggressive Skills, combat attacks, and targeted ranged effects. (Environmental hazards and area of effect attacks still function normally.) When this Skill is activated, the Mountebank must raise their fist into the air and call out ‘GILDED DAISY!’ Until 30 minutes pass or their hand is lowered, whichever comes first, the Mountebank may only move and speak - they cannot utilize any other Skills. This Skill does not allow the user to force others to move in any way, such as compelling a target to allow the Mountebank through a blocked doorway, nor does it allow them take items that do not belong to them without ending the effect. Automatically triggered effects such as traps still affect the Mountebank, and immediately end the effects of Gilded Daisy unless prevented by Bomb Awareness first. This Skill may only be used once per Twelves.",
  "Hung Jury": "People need a villain, and it’s a whole lot better if it’s not you. What’s more, people unified against a common enemy are people are easily guided. By vocalizing the reason for someone’s villainy, a Mountebank with this Skill may expend 10 Mind Points and sling a packet at a target. With this last slung insult, if the target is struck, the target of Hung Jury is unable to use the following Skills for the duration of 1 hour: Beg For Life, Charisma, Escape, Fade in a Crowd, or Vanish.",
  "Windfall": "Sometimes you just need a lot of money in a hurry. With this skill, a Mountebank can travel to Logistics and register that they are permanently losing a level of Income to immediately gain double their number of credits they would normally receive in total at Check In. Burned levels of Income are permanently lost, and must be repurchased later with Experience Points.",
  "The Change": "The first trigger of a Nephilim, the change causes extreme physical alterations to the body of the ascending Nephilim. Once this Skill is learned, the Nephilim must undergo the following costume changes to represent changes to the character’s body: solid color contact lenses must be worn at all times (white, red, or green) as well as stains of faded red on both hands and forearms. When The Change is learned the player undergoing The Change must undergo a thirty minute blessing performed by a priest of their faith other than themselves. During this time the hands of the character bleed and the eyes change. The vocal chords of the character change and it becomes painful to speak, making it so that Nephilim will not utter more than a few sentences an hour. Once The Change has been learned, the Nephilim that has learned The Change may spend 20 Mind Points to provide 20 points of spiritual armor to ANY (Red Star included) single willing target within reach of touch. This armor stacks on top of standard armor, however, cannot be applied to a target more than once per 12s and is depleted at the turn of the 12s. This armor is always the first armor lost.",
  "Avenging Angel": "The undead are blight. To a Nephilim, the blight must be purged from this world immediately. By expending 10 Mind Points and spending 5 minutes focusing their wrath through their melee weapon or brawler, a Nephilim with the Avenging Angel skill may have access to use of the Skill “Double Tap” for one hour at zero activation cost.",
  "Wrath": "If you read the stories of the old world it would seem that the wings of an angel are always dipped in blood. Caught between the land of the living and the land of the dead, a Nephilim is the embodiment of that concept. A Nephilim which has learned the advanced skill of Wrath may spend 20 Mind Points and enact a single brawler attack (brawling skill required). This single attack of Wrath allows the player using the attack to declare “Slaughter”. The use of slaughter may not be augmented with brews, Gizmos, weapons, or unique items however it may be combined with ‘Charge’ or ‘Killing Ground’. Other damage stacks or augmenters besides ‘Charge’ or ‘Killing Ground’ do not work with Wrath. The visual of this attack is that the Nephilim has reached forward and stuck their hand through the torso of the intended target.",
  "Broken Coils": "The inhuman and almost bestial nature of the Nephilim is never more apparent than when the Advance Skill Broken Coils is used. Once per event by expending 20 Mind Points a Nephilim with this Skill may release an almost operatic blast of inhuman screaming which can cause even the most focused fighters to turn and flee. When used the Nephilim with this Skill must first give remain perfectly still for thirty seconds with both arms extended outward at a 45 degree. After the half minute passes the Nephilim with Broken Coils must give an extremely loud scream and then yell ‘By my voice, Terror.’ This skill affects anyone who can hear the voice (friend and foe), as per the basic psionic Skill ‘Nightmares’. This Skill may only be used once per event, and may be resisted by mind resistance as per normal psionic attack.",
  "Meaning of Death": "The Nephilim do not die easy, nor do they die quietly. A Nephilim with the advance skill Meaning of Death may choose to take another with them into the depths of the Grave Mind. A Nephilim with this advanced skill, upon death, may point at a target within line of sight. That target takes 50 unavoidable body damage, and if this 50 damage is enough to drop the target in question, then the target of Meaning of Death skips their Bleed Out period and is considered immediately Killing Blowed. If the Nephilim with Meaning of Death is taking their final death, the damage done is increased to 100 unavoidable body damage and the target is considered Killing Blowed if this is enough to drop the target. Once Meaning of Death has been used, no means will prevent the infection rating from being removed from the Nephilims character sheet nor can the Nephilim use means to regain that infection rate EVER.",
  "Memories of Many": "An Oni is a Red Star warrior who has the strength of his cell with him at all times. With this skill an Oni may purchase a fourth and a fifth Basic Profession, restricted to starting Professions of their cell mates (only may learn from Red Star).",
  "Guardian Spirit": "Oni may wash their hands in blood, but sometimes find solace in aiding a new Red Star cell from afar. With this Skill, an Oni may watch over the youngest cell member in the area like a Guardian Spirit. Once a new cell comes into the city –‘new’ defined as less than 6 months spent in play– or a single Red Star member that has been in game for less than one year, an Oni may name that person or cell as its ward. This declaration should be made to staff, as the Oni can never let it be known that they protect a particular cell or Red Star member - if it is discovered, the Guardian Spirit tie is lost. By spending 20 Mind Points, the Oni may register with Logistics that they are activating this Skill. For the duration of the next hour the Oni causes 2 additional damage with melee weapon. The named ward will receive gifts from neighboring cells (sent via NPCs) to assist the new cell mates in excelling in this dangerous world.",
  "Walking Reminder": "An Oni with this Skill is fueled by the memories of martyred Red Star that fell in years past. By purchasing this Skill, an Oni may fashion a physical ‘death mask’ and wear it as a reminder of what can happen if a warrior cannot protect another. This must be represented by a suitably impressive physical representation. Once per Twelves, when an Oni wears their ceremonial death mask, they may expend 20 Mind Points and become overwhelmed with a fearsome warrior’s spirit. For the next 10 minutes the Oni gains use of the skills Bolt Action, Bow, Florentine, Melee Weapon Small, Melee Weapon Standard, Melee Weapon Large, Melee Weapon Two Handed, Throwing. During this 10 minutes usage of the Skill ‘Parry’ only costs 1 mind point.",
  "Shared Strength": "An Oni with this Skill may expend 20 Mind Points and 20 Health Points to become a whirlwind of zombie slaying. For the next 10 strikes each strike swung by the Oni has the effect “Kill Undead”. Each strike does zero damage to non-undead; however each successfully landed blow inflicts 100 points of damage on undead targets.",
  "Red Menace": "The Red Star was born in the first winters, and forged in the Nuclear Wynter. An Oni has been forged one more time, in the blood of its fallen comrades. This skill requires wearing their ’death mask’ and requires the expenditure of 20 Mind Points. When this skill is activated the Oni with this Skill takes zero points of damage from all damage that has the ‘radiation’ modifier for thirty minutes. In addition, after activating this power the Oni reduces all damage received by 1 for 5 minutes.",
  "Henchman": "What is an Overlord without faithful lackeys willing to endanger themselves to try and please their lord? By expending 20 Mind Points, an Overlord can contact one of their many faceless henchmen to complete a particular task- or die trying. The Overlord must go to Logistics and register that they are using this Skill. The task is specified by the Overlord, and the power level of the henchman is assigned by the staff, who will then assign an NPC to portray the minion. This NPC henchman will attempt to achieve the task assigned by the Overlord. This task cannot take more than 4 hours, and if it is not completed within 4 hours, the henchman commits suicide out of fear of the Overlord’s wrath. This Skill may only be activated up twice per weekend, though these uses may overlap in order to have two Henchmen (or perhaps a single, more powerful one) active at the same time. In the unlikely event that staff cannot provide an NPC to fulfill this task, the Overlord will be contacted and the Mind Points spent on this Skill refunded.",
  "Lair of Solitude": "Overlords need their privacy, and go through some impressive steps to ensure it. With this skill an Overlord can define a single private building as their Lair of Solitude by expending 20 Mind Points. When this is activated the Overlord may apply a single red ‘SECURITY LOCK 80’ Item Card to any and all entrances to this building. These entrances cannot be breached, broken into, or entered without the permission of the Overlord or the use of Skills which allow for the opening of a Crafts Level 80 lock. Those allowed entrance and exit must be listed on the back of the Item Card. This Skill does not ensure you a private cabin logistically, and we often recommend that an Overlord with this Skill bring a large multi-room tent with them to the event to ensure their privacy. This Skill may not be applied to a building which has already been inhabited by other players.",
  "Criminal Network": "This Skill allows for a true Overlord to get others to do their bidding, without them ever being aware of who’s pulling their strings. With an expenditure of 20 Mind Points an Overlord can put a mark on a target’s head, or a bounty on their life. The Overlord registers the action at Logistics, and at the next gathering of either Murder Inc. or the Black Market, a price will be offered on the target, anonymously billed as a ‘personal favor’ to the organization as a whole. Marks of this sort are highly sought after, and fulfilling them a token of pride amongst thieves and murderers.",
  "Deus ex Machina": "An Overlord can only be a power to be reckoned with as long as they are alive. Most Overlords will take any precaution they can to ensure that they live on. When an Overlord dies, they may permanently expend 10 Mind Points – permanently as in removed from the player’s sheet – to prevent losing an Infection Point. The Overlord has the option of returning to either the morgue or their own Lair of Solitude (if one has been set) with 10 Health Points instead of the standard 1 Health Point.",
  "Raise the Standard": "An Overlord sits at the top of a pyramid, and benefits greatly from the structure beneath them. With Raise the Standard, an Overlord can spend 5 Mind Points and craft a token. This token (often an arm band or insignia) can be worn by willing underlings. This underling must be paid a minimum of 1 Credit per event. In exchange, the Overlord gains 2 additional temporary Mind Points and Health Points at the Twelves above their standard cap for each underling they have at the event. These points go away the moment that an underling doesn’t receive pay, willingly removes the token, or suffers a death. An underling cannot serve multiple Overlords; in addition, if an underling ever asks to be taught the Overlord Advanced Profession while in the service of an Overlord, once the Profession is taught all points gained by Raise the Standard instead go to the new pupil for the duration of that weekend.",
  "Aura of Hate": "A Reaper is a bottomless well of hatred, rage, and the need to hurt others. This psychosis is apparent even at a glance, but it does have its advantages. By spending 10 Mind Points, calling out the name of their target and moving directly at the focus of their hate, a Reaper can ignore up to twenty seconds’ worth of strikes and effects. They must be en route from their current position to the location of their named target, they cannot deviate from this path, and their target must be at least 10 paces away. Once the Reaper reaches their target, the Aura of Hate drops and further strikes and effects count normally.",
  "Necessary Violence": "There is no such thing as overkill in the eyes of a Reaper, only just the right amount of force required to turn an enemy into a smear of paste on the ground. By expending 10 Mind Points, a Reaper may proceed to do additional damage to an enemy they have declared a Killing Blow upon. While this is simply cosmetic for the fallen foe, the Reaper regains Health Points equal to the highest total amount of damage done with a single strike. Necessary Violence may be combined with damage augmenting Skills at the additional cost of the second Skill.",
  "Killing Zone": "Watching a Reaper work on the field is like watching a wild animal chained to a post... as soon as something comes into range, the Reaper introduces them to a world of hurt. By expending 10 Mind Points a Reaper may plant both feet on the ground and create a Killing Zone. While the Reaper loses the ability to use the Skills Avoid and Charge, as well as the ability to actually move, all melee damage inflicted by the Reaper is increased by 10 points as long as they remain stationary. (Skills that cause a Reaper to be moved from the spot or knocked off their feet cause Killing Zone to come to an immediate end, if they are used successfully.) These additional 10 points of damage stack on top of any other Skills which normally inflict a set amount of damage. For example, using Frightening Force while in a Killing Zone causes 40 points of damage instead of 30 points.",
  "Dark Intentions": "The mind of a Reaper is a very dark place, and sometimes the rage and hatred that boils within a Reaper leaks out, poisoning the world around them. By spending 20 Mind Points, once per event a Reaper with this skill may let out a maddened yell and gesture at a single target. That target immediately takes 20 points of unavoidable damage, applied to armor first and then Health. If this shout is enough to drop the target into Bleed Out, then the Reaper regains 20 Mind Points, provided the target takes a death. If the target does not immediately receive a Killing Blow or Bleed Out after five minutes, then the user of Dark Intentions does not receive the 20 Mind Points.",
  "Sociopath Stalk": "The mind of a monster often affects how they move, walk, talk, and interact with the outside world. The Reaper may spend 10 Mind Points and become immune to the effects of the following Skills for 10 minutes: Beg for Life, Charisma, Lie, and any mind altering psionic Skills. Direct damage psionic attacks still affect the Reaper normally.",
  "House of Cards": "A Sage has spent very long time learning via texts, blueprints, and plain life experiences. This knowledge isn’t purely theoretical either – whether it’s finding kinks in the armor or knowing where a creature is most vulnerable, it is not uncommon for a Sage to have picked up a few tricks with dealing with threats. Once per event, after spending 10 minutes doing nothing other than observing a target – no other skills may be used during this time – a Sage can spend 10 Mind Points and bestow the effects of ‘House of Cards’ on themselves or a person within speaking distance. When ‘House of Cards’ is declared, the Sage must identify the subject they have studied to the recipient of this Skill and name a means of striking with a single weapon against that target: brawling, melee, ranged, or psionic. If the recipient of this Skill attacks as the Sage has instructed, the first attack against the studied target does two times the normal damage, factored after any other damage increasing effects have been added to the strike. This attack can still be defended against as per any other attack, so timing is important! If this attack is avoided, parried, or misses, ‘House of Cards’ is still considered expended.",
  "Simple Deduction": "Sages are a wealth of knowledge, and combined with simple observation they can make logical deductions that offer startling insight into a target. When a Lore check could be made, a Sage can expend 5 Mind Points and declare ‘Simple Deduction’. The target of Simple Deduction must then state what Lore would be appropriate to identify the subject. If the Sage continues to watch the target of Simple Deduction for 30 minutes, without it being killed or being rendered unconscious, the Sage may go to Logistics and spend Experience Points to learn this Lore as if they had learned from an appropriate teacher. Staff Members have final say regarding what Lore, if any, is appropriate to have been learned from the target in question.",
  "Leap of Reason": "Knowing information about a person is the same as having a degree of power over them. A Sage with this understanding can see the strengths in subjects - and weaknesses too. A Sage who has utilized Simple Deduction on a subject may choose to immediately expend 10 Mind Points to activate Leap of Reason on the same target, provided it is not currently in or fleeing combat. When Leap of Reason is activated, the Sage should place their hand over their head as if out-of-character and quickly approach the target. (An out-of-game headband is recommended if available.) The Sage may then ask the target three yes or no questions related to target’s health, skill set, mindset, or current intent. The Sage may not ask about prior motives, past events, aspects the target cannot perceive, or vague concepts of morality. The target can only respond with ‘yes’, ‘no’, or ‘non-applicable’ – they cannot elaborate further. This entire exchange is considered out of character – use of this Skill is not noticeable by others. It is not interrogation or psionic contact of any kind; these questions represent insights the Sage gleans from watching the target’s behavior. Some examples of questions that may be asked: “Do you intend to attack us?”, “Would you help us?”, “Are you an assassin?”, “Are you currently suffering from any illnesses?”, “Do you intend to betray us?” After receiving the answers, the Sage returns to where they were when they activated Leap of Reason. A hold is not called during the use of this Skill, and if the target is engaged or endangered while the questions are being asked, Leap of Reason comes to an immediate end regardless of the number of answers given.",
  "Strategy": "During a fight, most plans do not survive contact with the enemy. If properly orchestrated and organized, however, the first interaction with an enemy can change the flow of the battle. A Sage with the Strategy Skill can organize a group and design a plan for them to follow. Group members need not be close allies, but cannot be actively at odds with each other for this Skill to work. Planning the attack requires at least 10 minutes of roleplay spent instructing the recipients in the nuances of the plan; at the end of this time, the Sage orchestrating the Strategy can expend 20 Mind Points to bestow a damage reduction of 2 to all individuals within a ten foot radius. These individuals must have attended the brie ng and agreed to follow the plan in order to receive this benefit. This damage reduction lasts 1 hour, and may not be stacked with other damage reduction effects.",
  "Pure Genius": "When a Sage reaches a certain point in their life, they understand that they will never be able to reach and teach everyone they want to. The desire to share wisdom – as well as the desire to get some of their own studies done uninterrupted! – drives some Sages to create teaching manuals. By spending 10 Mind Points and 30 minutes roleplaying creating a text, as well as furnishing a suitable prop, once per event a Sage may create a text that works as a single use skill teacher. Learning follows all the normal rules; simply count the text as the teacher. Pure Genius texts are considered unique item cards, and the item card must have the crafting Sage’s character name and character number on the text (for database purposes). The Sage must possess the Skill to be taught by the text at time of its creation. If the Skill has particular prerequisites, a student must also meet those in order to learn from the text. Literacy is a requirement to learn from a Pure Genius text. Professions, Advanced Professions and Advanced Profession Skills cannot be taught by these texts. A text can be recreated with the Transcribe Skill at a cost of 10 Mind Points and 30 minutes roleplaying copying the text. Transcription requirements must be written on the card attached to the book at its creation. Pure Genius teaching manuals have an expiration date of 1 year, and are not expended when used to teach.",
  "Life Giver": "All Saints, be they teachers or preachers by design, can heal those that hurt. Once per event a Saint may expend 10 Mind Points and all remaining Health Points and enter a 1 minute Bleed Out period. As this happens, the Saint loudly announces ‘BY MY VOICE, HEAL ALL!’ All those who can hear the Saint, be they ally or enemy, immediately return to full Health Points. Only those that hear the initial call receive the effects; this effect may not be ‘telephoned’ to others, so if people do not OOC hear the initial declaration, then they do not receive the healing bene ts of this skill. The Saint may only have their Bleed Out process stopped by Faith Healing (no other means will work). If the Saint who has entered Bleed Out takes a death due to use of this Skill, all allies within 5 feet of the Saint at the time of her death gain damage reduction 2 for the next 30 minutes.",
  "Inner Peace": "Filled with devotion to their cause, a Saint’s mind works differently than those living a more everyday existence, and so they find themselves strangely untouched by the fears and provocations of others. Their sense of self is simply too strong. This Skill costs nothing to activate; however, after purchasing it the Saint becomes totally immune to Charisma, Fear, Fearful Glare, Terror, Challenge, and Body Puppet. When these Skills are used on the Saint, a serene chant of ‘No Effect, Inner Peace’ is declared in response.",
  "Miracle Worker": "Tales of the truly pious being able to perform miracles are not uncommon, nor are they unfounded. Saints with this level of piety must believe in one of the established, organized religions, and through that faith they can cause minor miracles to occur with the expenditure of 10 Mind Points and 20 minutes spent roleplaying blessing a 10 foot radius area. This effect may only be used once per event, and players may only receive the advantages of this Skill once per event. This Skill requires the Saint’s player to have appropriate props and effects to represent the accompanying visual manifestations. {p} {table:2} Faith Followed ||| Effect ||| Church of Darwin ||| The blessed area glows green for 10 minutes, and provides renewed strength and health to followers of Darwin who bask and pray in the holy glow. All followers of Darwin who enter this space refresh 5 Mind Points and 5 Health. Bless Weapon costs zero Mind Points to use during this time, if performed by a Priest of the Church of Darwin. ||| Church of Telling Visions ||| The blessed area glows a flickering white for 10 minutes, providing renewed mental clarity to followers of the Telling Visions who find comfort in the static. All followers of Telling Visions who enter the space refresh 10 Mind Points. Bless Weapon costs zero Mind Points to use during this time, if performed by a Priest of Telling Visions. ||| Cult of Fallow Hopes ||| The blessed area glows with a warm orange/yellow light for 10 minutes, and provides renewed strength and health to followers of the Fallow Hopes, who take solace in the firelight. All followers of Fallow Hopes who enter this space refresh 10 Health Points. Bless Weapon costs zero Mind Points to use during this time, if performed by a Priest of Fallow Hope. ||| Light of Hedon ||| A 30’ radius area glows with a multitude of colored lights for 10 minutes, as scented smoke fills the area. This area renews followers of the Light of Hedon as they revel in this holy space. Followers of the Light of Hedon who enter this space regain 10 Mind Points. Bless Weapon costs zero Mind Points to use during this time, if performed by a Priest of the Light of Hedon. ||| Nuclear Family ||| The blessed area glows with the light of many flickering candles for 10 minutes, providing incredible unity to followers of the Nuclear Family who come together there. Those that bask in this light gain the Red Star (may not be turned against Nuclear Family members) advantage in regards to other members of the Nuclear Family for 24 hours. ||| Sainthood of Ashes ||| For 10 minutes, three lanterns in the blessed area begin to glow so brightly that they are almost blinding to look at directly. All followers of the Sainthood of Ashes that touch one of these lanterns find themselves refocused in regards to their willingness to help others. All followers of the Sainthood of Ashes that enter this space regain 10 Mind Points and receive 10 points of enhanced armor that lasts until the next 12s. This armor is the first armor damaged or destroyed in combat and may not be repaired.  ||| Tribes of the Seasons ||| A tree in the blessed area begins to glow with faint white light, radiating peaceful energies that restore flagging spirits. A representative of each season may rest beneath this tree for 20 minutes; at the end of this meditative period, they recover up to 30 Mind Points. Resting members may speak quietly, but cannot move or use skills that require more activity. ||| Virtues of the Kings Court ||| Loud music begins to play with no particular source, the songs tied to the particular idol(s) that the Saint follows. All believers in the Kings Court who listen to at least 20 minutes of the music receive either damage reduction 1 or an increased damage of 1 for up to 3 hours, their choice.",
  "Live Again": "At times, a Saint can place some of their own well-earned karma into another, and by doing so turn back even death itself. Once per event, a Saint may spend 20 Mind Points and 20 Health Points on someone who has died no more than 5 minutes previously; if successful, that person returns to life, and does not lose an Infection Rate. An individual receiving this effect begins their death description with the game Director, and then sees the Saint guiding them back to life. This Skill may not be used on Red Star.",
  "The Final Cause": "Every Saint lives piously and according to their beliefs; many of them also have the opportunity to die helping others. At any time, a Saint with this Skill may willingly choose final death, and leave a lasting memory with those around them. This Skill may even be used while in Bleed Out. To use this Skill, the Saint simply names an individual with their dying breath, and then travels to Logistics to alert staff to their death as well as the use of this Skill. (The Saint may also use this time to prepare suitable props and costuming for the vision to follow, though they should not delay the vision more than absolutely necessary.) The target of this Skill can be anywhere in game, though they must be at the current event, and cannot be a secondary character to the Saint’s player. This individual receives a final, one minute vision from the Saint, which should be roleplayed by the deceased Saint. This vision is visible to everyone around the target as well, and it is highly encouraged that steps be taken to make it miraculous and awe-inspiring. When the Saint appears to the target, they may say whatever they like, but as a game effect they may choose to ask if the target is willing to follow in the Saint’s path. If the target agrees, they count as having effectively been taught the Advanced Profession: Saint. This player has one year from the moment of their vision to ful ll the requirements for the Saint profession; if they do not do so, the path is lost forever and that player may never become a Saint. Recipients of this Skill may not actually purchase the Advanced Profession or its Skills until such a time as they meet its requirements. The moment all requirements are met and the recipient purchases this Advanced Profession, Logistics must be contacted. Before the next Twelves, the would-be Saint will have their resolve tested. Failure in this test delays becoming a Saint until the next event. Use of The Final Cause ignores the normal 6 month wait time for teaching Advanced Professions.",
  "Unseen Hands": "A master of the art of pilfering items undetected, a Shadow can effectively utilize the Pick Pockets skill once per event, without the need for clothespins. By spending 10 Mind Points, a Shadow may register with a Staff Member that they will be using Unseen Hands on a particular person and a particular pocket or container. The Shadow then just needs to stand next to the target for 1 minute. Shortly after, a Staff Member will approach the victim and recover the stolen goods to be held for the Shadow at Logistics.",
  "Lurking Threat": "Most accidents happen within a mile of home- however 100% of all home assaults happen there. Once per event, a Shadow can spend 20 Mind Points to enter and/or exit a person’s home in a way that completely bypasses all existing locks, traps, barricades or other deterrents to entry. (Only devices on entrances are bypassed; interior traps or locks must be dealt with normally.) The only exception is an Overlord’s special ‘Lair of Solitude’, which cannot be penetrated by this Skill. Indeed, all locks, traps and barricades are completely left untouched, leaving no sign of how someone bypassed them. If used to gain access to a location, the Shadow must depart within 5 minutes; failure to do so means that this Skill’s bene ts end and they must contend with any locks, traps or barricades normally on their way out. If witnessed by onlookers, the user of Lurking Threat should describe this Skill with phrases such as ‘I climb to the roof, shimmy down the incredibly thin chimney, and vanish from sight’. Remember that cabin raiding may require the presence of a member of the game staff.",
  "Inner Circle": "Inner Circle membership is an honor that certain elite Shadows earn over time. Viewed as ‘made men’ of Murder Inc., Shadows with this Skill have the power to spare a life with a single word or doom someone with the same. After reviewing the list at Logistics, they may remove any current contract with an expenditure of 10 Mind Points. No reason is needed or required – the Shadow’s word is enough. On the other hand, Inner Circle members may choose to spend 10 Mind Points to name a target as an ‘Honor Hunt’ for members of Murder Inc. ‘Honor Hunt’ targets are the highest prize offered to Murder Inc. members, and the Shadow can certainly expect serious efforts will be made to fulfill that contract. A player with this Skill may only name one ‘Honor Hunt’ every 6 months.",
  "Sandman": "A sleeping opponent is a vulnerable one; those that believe otherwise are deluding themselves, as a Shadow is only too able to prove. A Shadow with this Skill can only use it if they can reach melee range of a sleeping target without waking them up. At this point, the Shadow may expend 20 Mind Points and make a successful melee attack on the individual. The target takes 50 points of damage, which ignores all forms of armor. This Skill is not a Killing Blow, but it does have the effects of Choking Blow – the affected target cannot speak or use vocal Skills, though they can still move. An individual struck by Sandman may not use any Skills to avoid this damage.",
  "Never Here": "This Skill is the last line defense for a Shadow about to be captured. By spending 10 Mind Points, a Shadow can declare ‘NEVER HERE’ to escape from a scene, vanishing in a puff of smoke. This Skill allows the Shadow to immediately put on an out-of-game headband or place their hand over their head to signify that they are no longer present, at which point they may walk to Logistics, who will tell them where and when to reappear. This Skill may only be used once per event. Never Here may not be used by a character who is currently under the effects of ‘Blinding’, ‘Nail’, or has both legs ‘Mangled’ or ‘Sundered’.",
  "Breaking Point": "There is nothing more terrifying than seeing a calm and resourceful person completely lose their shit. By spending 5 minutes expounding in a loud, animated, and detailed exposition in regards to how the Shepherd of the Land who is using Breaking Point has had “enough of this nonsense” the Shepherd of the Land may expend 10 Mind Points and declare “By my voice, TERROR”. All persons within earshot must then either expend a Mind Resist or run from the user of Breaking Point for a minimum of 10 minutes. This Skill may only be used once per event and does not affect Full Dead or the Undead.",
  "Gossip Hound": "The people who work the hardest are often those that often facilitate and perpetuate gossip and rumors. By expending 10 Mind Points a Shepherd of the Land using Gossip hound may write down a single rumor, no more than 20 words long, and hand that rumor to the director of the game they are at (we also suggest sending a reminder email after the event since game directors are so busy). The rumor provided will be implemented in the next months Bartenders Tongue for the game. By expending 20 Mind Points, a Shepherd of the Land using Gossip Hound may instead have their rumor appear in the public rumors instead of the Bartenders Tongue. Any rumors found to be personal attacks to a player instead of a character may be changed by Staff Members to make the rumor more appropriate for game.",
  "Gracious Guest": "Taking care of the people around you often times involves taking care of the environment around you. A healthy person who resides in a place of sickness will become sick, and a sick person who resides in a place of sickness will never grow healthy. A Shepherd of the Land understands that people need to be Gracious Guests of the land they inhabit. By spending 1 Hour roleplaying cleaning and prepping an area that is at least 10x10 (feel free to actually clean) once per 12s a Shepherd of the Land can expend 20 Mind Points and produce one of the following effects in the cleared/cleaned area: {p} {table:4} Name of 10x10 Space ||| Location ||| Effect ||| Duration ||| Cleared Farmland ||| Outside In Open Field. Marked off 10x10 area ||| Farming takes 1/2 time. One user at a time. ||| Until 12s ||| Community Space ||| Open outdoor picnic area marked off OR indoor public area. Indoor public areas cannot have locked doors during duration of Community Space. 10x10 area. ||| 1 Liter of craft 5 Hootch Consumed. Heals 5 Health (requires card). Entire liter must be consumed by one person inside the community space. ||| Until 12s ||| Workspace ||| Location must have either a Kitchen, Printers table, Still, Workbench, or Forge. Indoor 10x10 area. ||| Increases total available allowed users of the assigned equipment by 3. Only one crafter tool (Forge, Printer table, etc) may be assigned to a Workspace. Once the item is removed from the Workspace the effects come to an end. ||| Until 12s",
  "Helping Hand": "Every now and then you need to be able to go to your hidden reserves inside you to help those around you. A Shepherd of the Land with the Helping Hands Skill understands that every now and then you need to tap into those reserves to work a little harder. By expending 10 Mind Points when cooking Healthy Feast, Brewing, Fishing, or Farming you may produce two additional serving of that particular Brew, feast, Produce, or Herb. This additional volume does not require any additional time expenditure for production, harvest, or preparation, however only one use of production via Helping Hands is turned over to the Shepherd of the Land. The second serving is added to seeding for scrounging, gifted to a new player, or placed on a new player module by Staff Members. This Skill may only be used once per 12s.",
  "More To Give": "Self-sacrifice isn’t necessary to keep people going; sometimes all it takes is a bit of forethought and preparation. Once per event a Shepherd of the Land may expend 10 Mind Points to duplicate a single serving of brew or food that they have ‘stashed away for an emergency’. When going to Logistics to utilize this Skill you will be issued a card identical to a non-expired food or brew card that you bring with you to Logistics. The new card you are given will have an expiration date of the next 12s, however, you may immediately bring this item into play as you have ‘Remembered you stored one of these away for just such an emergency’.",
  "Calloused Hands": "A Survivor with this Skill has scratched and worked nearly every day of their life. From manual labor to fighting to live, a Survivor has the ability to do what needs to be done without breaking under the labor. Whenever Brewing, Building a Better Tomorrow, Forging the Future, Cooking, Scrounging, Farming, or performing First Aide, as long as the player with this Skill leaves one hand on their current project they may utilize combat Skills with their offhand without their current project being ruined or having their completion timer reset.",
  "Scarred Bones": "Chances are good that by the time someone becomes a Survivor, they have had their limbs mangled so many times that there is more scarring than clean bone on their frame. A Survivor with this Advanced Skill may have Mangled limbs repaired with a simple application of First Aide instead of requiring Fix Limb. Standard means of limb repair will work as per normal; however, they are not required.",
  "Jaded World View": "A true survivor has seen it all, made notes of the bad spots, and has experienced so much that very little shakes them to their foundation any more. A Survivor with this Advanced Skill shrugs off temporary derangements at the end of the next Twelves instead of at the end of an event weekend. In addition, a survivor with this aAvanced Skill may spend 10 Mind Points at the time of receiving a permanent derangement to instead receive the temporary version of the same derangement.",
  "Iron Kidney": "In their travels a Survivor has consumed all sorts of rancid, vile, poisonous, and intoxicating substances; often times on purpose. A Survivor with this Advanced Skill may expend 5 Mind Points to negate the effects of intoxication. In addition a Survivor with this Skill may expend 10 Mind Points to ignore addictive or sensory effecting effects of a single brew they have inhaled, consumed, injected, or drank.",
  "Pack Mule": "Sometimes a Survivor needs to be able to grab and go with all of their worldly possessions on their back. By expend 10 Mind Points a Survivor with this Advanced Skill can move at full speed regardless of the carry rate of an object, as long as they expend the appropriate number of points for the carry. In addition, use of the Skill Carry used in conjunction with spending for Pack Mule will extend the use of the duration of Carry to Ten Minutes.",
  "Elementary!": "A Techno Savant forgets more Lore than most people ever memorize. With an expenditure of 5 Mind Points a Techno Savant with this skill may call on a single use of one of the following skills: Lore (Complex Electronics); Lore (Doomsday Device); Lore (Tesla Electronics); Lore (Biological Warfare); Lore (Gizmos); or Lore (Esoteric Cultural Anomalies); or Lore (Structural Anomalies). This Skill may only be used once per Twelves, and the Techno Savant may not teach Lore obtained with the Skill to others.",
  "Eureka!": "A Techno Savant with this Skill has the capacity to design original blueprints for Augments, Gizmos, Engineering Prints, and Armor (not weapons or traps) that have not been created before. This Skill requires extensive work with the staff for the approval of a design between events, and approval from both branch and network must be obtained BEFORE roleplaying the creation of a new blueprint. All blueprints produced via Eureka will not be able to be duplicated, transcribed, or recreated in any way shape or form. The process of introducing an approved Gizmo blueprint into game should take at least half an hour of roleplaying the scientific discovery. This Skill may only be used once every six months and any item produced from a Eureka! Blueprint will have a maximum lifespan of 6 months. Use of Eureka! Costs 20 Mind Points.",
  "Brilliant!": "While weapons can be broken, in the heat of the moment Techno Savants can squeeze a little more use out of a broken weapon as long as it has not actually been Chopped. To use this Skill, the Techno Savant must place their hand on the weapon in question and spend 5 Mind Points. The weapon will continue to work for up to an hour as long as the Techno Savant continues to hold the weapon, or at least keeps one hand on the device to ‘hold it together’.",
  "Genius!": "By making a significant effort at scientific progress, a Techno Savant is capable of producing a signature weapon Melee Weapon, Bolt Action weapon, or Room Augmentation; one that is capable of truly amazing things. What exactly it does, however, is somewhat... unpredictable. Upon creation of this weapon, a single sealed packet will be attached to the back of the Item Card. This packet represents a feature that has been added to the weapon. These features are often incredible, but they’re not always safe. Using or even opening the packet causes the effects to go off within seconds of it being opened. The effect’s timing is variable, i.e., meaning that how long it takes to open and read the packet is how long it takes to go off (holds are not called for this). Unfortunately, use of these cards causes the Genius! creation to burn out. These additions cost 10 Mind Points and 20 minutes of extensive crafting roleplaying at a Work Bench to add on to a weapon. Once the packet is used, the original weapon remains (unless the packet states otherwise).",
  "Excelsior!": "A Techno Savant who is worth their weight in transistors has also endured more than their share of poison, radiation, and explosive shrapnel at the hands of their own inventions. By the time a mere scientist has become a Techno Savant, they have grown accustomed to most forms of technological abuse. With the expenditure of 10 Mind Points, a Techno Savant can triple the damage from a single trap or Gizmo that they have triggered. Assuming the experience does not kill the Techno Savant, they will be able to produce a single Blueprint for that device for future recreation. Damage received in this way ignores all forms of armor, and cannot be avoided. If the Gizmo or trap does no damage to the Techno Savant, then no Blueprint can be produced via this Skill. Gizmos created through Eureka! cannot have blueprints created in this way.",
  "Shattered Psyche": "The first Skill that any Thought Bender must learn, Shattered Psyche is an attack upon one’s own ego. When this Skill is purchased, the Thought Bender gains 10 permanent Mind Points and 10 permanent Health Points. Mental boundaries are blurred as well, as the Thought Bender taps into the collective subconscious to augment their own capabilities. Once Shattered Psyche is purchased, the Thought Bender gains the permanent derangement ‘Multiple Personality Disorder.’ This derangement cannot be cured or suppressed so long as the character remains a Thought Bender. The primary personality and the secondary personality are completely unaware of each other, and actively resist any attempt to be reconciled or otherwise made aware of their shared circumstance. Even if indisputable proof is offered, a personality will quickly rationalize it away and forget about it within minutes; if personalities are found to be actively working together, this skill may be revoked, along with all other Thought Bender abilities. A full costume change and extensive roleplaying are required to portray the two personalities, as it is always a drastic transformation; the two identities will never be mistaken for each other. Switching between personalities therefore takes as long as it does to switch costumes and change mannerisms, and regardless of other preparations, it should never be instantaneous. Unless otherwise noted, a personality switch only occurs when the player desires - and it is always an OOC decision, since the personalities are not aware of each other - though it is recommended that the player develop some general ideas about the type of situations and emotions that trigger a change, to give consistency to the personalities and the circumstances when they take charge. This Skill may only be purchased once.",
  "Duality": "With the purchase of this Skill a Thought Bender gains the ability to learn fourth and fifth Professions, as per standard Profession costs and requirements, with the exception that these Professions can only be accessed by the secondary personality. The Professions, as well as the Skills learned within these Professions, will be marked with a (2nd) after them on the character sheet. Once Duality has been purchased, the secondary Personality loses ability to use any Skills or Professions gained by the primary personality.",
  "Grave Mind": "There is a humming deep under the collective embodiment of the shambling horde, one that the shattered mind of a Thought Bender can access. When facing a shambling zombie, a Thought Bender may spend 20 Mind Points and engage a ranged psionic attack. If the attack succeeds, the Thought Bender gains basic mental control of the shambling zombie and is able to direct it with verbal commands for 30 minutes. Once the 30 minutes have passed, the control ends and the Thought Bender’s personality immediately begins shifting to its other persona.",
  "My Little Friend": "This Skill brings the psychosis and nightmares of a Thought Bender into the real world. After spending 20 Mind Points and 10 Health Points, the Thought Bender may record their action at Logistics. At this point a physical manifestation of the psionic energy released by the Thought Bender assaults a single target (or target type description) named by the Thought Bender at time of activation. The orders given to this psionic creature cannot be anything other than malicious. This psionic creature will attack for the full duration of 2 hours, returning time and again like horror movie monster if it is killed. In addition, during the full 2 hours the psionic creature is released, the Thought Bender is incapable of switching personalities for any reason.",
  "Mental Breakdown": "The single most awesome and terrifying ability of a Thought Bender is their ability to upload their mind into the collective unconscious as the body dies. Faced with impending death, a Thought Bender may permanently expend their final Infection Rate and enter final death. The mind of the Thought Bender is then downloaded into a new body, created completely by the staff with the one third of the old body’s spent Experience Points and an Infection Rate of 2. Exactly how this new body comes to be inhabited is a matter of some speculation and no certainty. Some say they are created whole from raw psionic energies, fresh-forged from the raw stuff of creation through sheer force of will; others whisper that the Thought Bender steals into the body of one freshly dead and takes it for their own, in a warped parody of the Grave Mind. A few dark rumors even suggest that the body need not be either new or dead... but if any of these theories are true, no one know for sure. {p} Note: No matter its origins, this new body keeps the memories of one of the two former personalities, and is never a Psionic.",
  "Been There Did That": "With the expenditure of 10 Mind Points, a Veteran with this Skill can check to see if someone’s story is true in regards to where they claim they have been or where they come from. This Skill requires 10 minutes of roleplaying asking details of the target’s origin, such as names of people or locations they knew, and at the end of that 10 minutes the user of Been There Did That can either catch the individual in a lie, or, confirm their origins by asking for OOC confirmation from the player. This Skill may only be used to determine what townships, territories, or locations an individual has traveled through or lived in, not what buildings they have visited or activities they undertook in those locations. If this Skill is used on someone where their background has not been approved, this Skill results in a ‘very doubtful’ response.",
  "Dirty Connections": "You may not be a member of the Black Market, you may not be a business member of Murder Inc., however you have been around long enough that you are pretty sure you know how to get in touch with these people. By spending 10 Mind Points and writing a letter to give to Logistics, that letter will be delivered to either a Murder Inc. or Black Market representative by the next event at latest. This letter is assumed to be left at either an old gathering place or old drop point, and will be delivered out-of-character. This Skill may be used to attempt to purchase favors, protection, or contracts from the appropriate organization.",
  "Knows A Guy": "With enough time, you can get to know the movers and shakers in the ‘get things done’ communities. With an expenditure of 20 Mind Points and registering the use of ‘Knows a Guy’ with the game director, an NPC with one of the following Advanced Professions will travel to town to hear your request for aid either that event or the next event (Director’s discretion). This request for assistance will not be all encompassing, and often will be very costly once the individual arrives, however sometimes having that assistance is key to getting things done. The Advanced Profession representative NPCs that can be contacted are Mercenary, Grave Robber, or Techno Savant. This Skill may only be used once every six months and will require extensive roleplaying for any form of teaching (teaching not guaranteed).",
  "Owed Favors": "Do enough work over a long enough period of time, and someone is going to owe you one. A Veteran with the advantage of Owed Favors can spend 20 Mind Points and register at logistics that they are using ‘Owed Favors’ once per event. When activating Owed Favors the Veteran rolls a single 10 sided die to determine the outcome of Owed Favors in relation to the following table: {p} {table:2} Die Roll ||| Result ||| 1,2 ||| Able to get a single Named Scrap or Named Herb of rollers choice for 50 of the local currency. ||| 3,4 ||| Able to get a single Named Scrap or Named Herb of rollers choice for 40 of the local currency. ||| 5,6 ||| Able to get a single Named Scrap or Named Herb of rollers choice for 30 of the local currency. ||| 7 ||| Able to get a single Named Scrap or Named Herb of rollers choice for 20 of the local currency. ||| 8 ||| Able to get a single Named Scrap or Named Herb of rollers choice for 10 of the local currency. ||| 9 ||| Able to get a single Named Scrap or Named Herb of rollers choice for free. ||| 10 ||| Able to get a single Named Scrap or Named Herb of the rollers choice and 5 basic Herbs for free.",
  "Prior Enemies": "Over a long enough period of time, a Veteran grows to have a particular hatred for a specific kind of zombie. When taking the Skill ‘Prior Enemies’ the owner of the Skill names a particular kind of undead (Shambler, Hunter, Burster, Tank, etc.) or a particular strain of humanity (Red Star, Retrograde, Pure Blood, etc). Once per twelves the user of Prior Enemies may expend 10 Mind Points to have all weapons used by the Veteran with the Prior Enemies skill gain the trait ‘X Bane’ where ‘X’ is the enemy type chosen for the next half hour. Bane trumps all other damage modifiers that would be used on a weapon, and each weapon may only have Bane verses a single target. As an example, if a Veteran with Prior Enemies ‘Hunter Zombies’ is wielding a blade that normally does 2 points of damage, has poison on it that does 10 points of poison damage, and they activate Prior Enemies, that blade now does 12 points of Hunter Bane (12 points against targets that are not Hunter zombies, and 24 points of damage against Hunter zombies).",
  "Protection Racket": "Ever wonder how it is that a thief is able to keep themselves from being caught? Well, there is an entire network of people that ensure that the best thieves have all the tools they need to keep their personas hidden. By expending 30 credits or 50 basic Scrap at Logistics, a Villon with the Protection Racket Advanced Skill can step into an established alternate identity for up to 24 hours. This identity can be of any Strain and use of Lores, Society Memberships, and Analyze Creature will all report that the disguise persona is accurate for the name and Strain of the disguise. In addition this disguise may not be removed by any means other than willing removal by the Villon using the advantage of the Protection Racket (disguise remains even through death if the Villon wishes it to). Each identity taken by the Villon will be provided a Gizmo card with a one month expiration date showing that the Protection Racket has done the leg work to fill in the back story of a falsi ed identity. Personas that have memberships into societies, communes, or set organizations may cost an additional 10 credits or 20 Herb/Scrap at Storyteller’s discretion.",
  "Nimble Fingers": "Any thief can grab something out of a pocket, a Villon on the other hand can tell the value of items by touch. Instead of activating Pick Pockets, a Villon can spend 10 Mind Points to enact Nimble Fingers. The Villon using this Advanced Skill must register their expenditure with a Marshal and then clip the pocket/bag they wish to rob. Instead of taking a single item at random from that pocket, the Villon will receive the item of the highest Crafts Level or value from that pocket. The Villon must inform the Marshal at time of activation if value or Crafts Level is the intended target.",
  "Fence": "So what good is a high-end item if you can’t get rid of it? Fortunately the Villon knows people who know people, who can turn around and try to sell hot items at the Black Market for them. A Fence will only take items of the highest quality, and may turn down items too generic for Black Market sale, however the Villon with the Fence Advanced Skill may show items to the Black Market representative at Check In to put those items up for sale at the Black Market. The Black Market representative will never betray who gave them the items to sell, however, they will take a small cut of the income for their interests. In addition, items sold to a Fence may have a minimum price assigned to them; however, the Fence will try to get as much as possible for your wares.",
  "Running Numbers": "Sometimes getting a job done is all about having the right number of people doing the right number of things at the right time. By spending 30 minutes setting a plan and preparing with their cohorts and by spending 20 Mind Points, a Villon may extend their criminal expertise to a team of no more than 4 other people. The four targets of Running Numbers gain the effects of Disguise for a duration of 1 hour as well as one use of Balance and Escape that expires in 1 hour. Each sheet receiving this bonus must have ‘Running Numbers’ recorded in their expenditure section. It is highly suggested that a character using the Running Numbers Skill has already use the Protection Racket Skill to ensure that their identity is hidden from their mook assistants. This Skill may only be used once per event.",
  "Well Shit": "Locks are a fantastic thing; however, they become completely useless once you have a key to the lock. By registering with a Marshal and then roleplaying analyzing a lock (must be within reaching distance of the lock the entire time) for 10 minutes per Crafts Level of the lock and spending 30 Mind Points, a Villon may then jot down the key code listed on the lock. With this code the Villon can then go directly to a Workbench to create a short term key for that lock. Key production itself only takes 5 minutes, however, each key produced in this way requires 1 basic Scrap and will expire within 24 hours. Locks that use multiple keys will require multiple expenditures of time, Mind Points, and Scrap.",
  "Absorb": "This ability allows a creature to learn Skills and traits, instantly accessing them. To Absorb a skill, the creature must witness the Skill being used and declare “Absorb 1, Absorb 2, Absorb 3. Absorb ‘X’ Skill” where ‘X’ is the target skill.",
  "Agony": "Countered by Parry, Avoid, or Refuse depending on delivery method. For example, if a ranged bullet is accompanied by “Agony,” then you can use “Avoid” to negate the attack. This ability causes 10 seconds of excruciating pain. After a successful Ranged or Melee Attack, the user must declare “Agony, Dazed 10 seconds”.",
  "Animate": "This ability allows a creature to reanimate fallen zombies and survivors who have bled out to fight as shamblers with 10 Body swinging 1 Damage. Small melee weapons or brawling boffers should be used if available; longer melee weapons should be short hafted as needed.",

Like sharks at a kill, surrounding zombies frenzy, relentlessly attacking the target of Blood Scent. After landing a successful Ranged Attack, the user of the Skill must call “Blood Scent!

  "Burrow": "A creature may declare “Burrow!” and point at the ground with their other forearm in front of their face, and immediately move to another point within 40 steps of entry before resurfacing.

  "Cleave": "Countered by Parry. This ability is a devastating melee strike called as “Cleave! Disarm, 10 Damage”",
  "Confuse": "Countered by Mind Resist. Friends become enemies and enemies become friends for ten minutes. Unlike Body Puppet, a person affected by Confuse is required to attack and may not flee. The Confused target will fight to the fullest of their ability and skill.",
  "Daze": "Countered by Parry, Avoid, or Mind Resist depending on delivery method. This ranged or melee effect prevents the target from using any offensive abilities or move for its duration.

Further information can be found in the Diseases Appendix.",
  "Enslavement": "Countered by Mind Resist. This psionic ability causes a target to follow a single simple non-self destructive command. ‘Defend me,’ ‘Bring me X item,’ or ‘Kill X person’ are all samples of Enslavement. Enslavement can be defended against with Mind Resist and lasts for 30 minutes or until Bleed Out.",
  "Fear": "Countered by Refuse. This ability inspires tremendous Fear of the user in its target for five minute unless otherwise stated. By declaring “Fear, cannot attack me, five Minutes!” the target cannot attack or engage the user. Unless otherwise noted, a target may still defend themselves, but will always prioritize fleeing over fighting whenever possible.",
  "Flight": "Creatures with this rare skill are immune to melee attacks due to being out of range, though ranged attacks still work at a 1 damage reduction. Flight is represented by creatures pointing at the sky.",
  "Frenzy": "When seriously wounded, some heavily infected beings can enter a state where pain no longer matters. Creatures that Frenzy take very little damage from strikes, becoming immune to Mangled Limbs, Fear, Nail, Charisma, and psionics for 10 minutes.",
  "Gnaw": "When a creature with this ability comes on a helpless or bleeding target, they can double over and begin to call ‘Gnaw’. Gnawing a person inflicts 1 damage every 10 seconds, and causes agonizing pain to the person being gnawed. If someone is in Bleed Out, this damage does not stack nor shorten the count - however it does cause the person being gnawed on to scream in pain as they are being eaten alive. If someone has used Feign Death, these points of damage do indeed strike and cannot be reduced. Zombies that Gnaw regain 5 Health every 10 seconds of uninterrupted Gnawing. To simulate the use of Gnaw, individuals using the Skill should crouch low over the target of their gnawing and call out ‘Gnaw 1, Gnaw 2...’ until they reach ‘Gnaw 10’. At the end of Gnaw 10, the recipient of Gnaw takes 1 damage and the individual using Gnaw regains Health.",

An Impale attack pins the struck limb of its target until the striking weapon, fang or claw can either be removed via a Mangle Limb or destroying the impaling creature.

Impaled targets lose the ability to use ranged weapons or melee weapons of Standard size or larger, but can still make brawling attacks, melee Small weapons, and use psionics.",
  "Melt": "Countered by Parry or Avoid depending on delivery. This Skill works the same as Break Weapon, Armor, or shield except that it brings that Crafts Level of the affected item down by a Crafts Level when it is used. For example, a Crafts Level 3 item would become a Crafts Level 2 item. Items that are Crafts Level 1 stay at crafts level 1.",
  "Rip Through": "This ability allows the user to remove Nail or Impale effects by rippingthemselves free of the offending weapon. This effect causes the user to take five Body damage.",
  "Shatter": "Countered by Parry. Shields are great for defending against all manners of creatures, but a few have come up with answers to the noble shield. A creature can call “Shatter! Break Shield, Mangle Limb” and strike the target’s shield to incapacitate their shield arm and shield in one go.",
  "Slaughter": "Countered by Parry as long as the Slaughter hits you from the front. A horrific attack, hearing a creature declare ‘SLAUGHTER!’ is a sure sign that you should run. Slaughter deals 50 points of Body damage. If a target is dropped into Bleed Out due to a Slaughter, that target has a shortened one minute Bleed Out (regardless of effects that extend Bleed Out times). Seriously. Run!",
  "Snare": "Countered by Parry, Avoid, Carry ‘X’, or Bomb Awareness, depending on delivery. Some creatures and items can completely bind and immobilize a target instantly. Snare effects trap the target, pinning their legs and arms, preventing any movement or the use of weapons and Skills except for Carry. The target may still speak and use psionics. The Snare can be removed by overcoming value ‘X’ with a sufficient Carry Rating via the Carry, Rescue, or natural strength of characters freeing the target.

  "Sunder Limb": "Countered by Parry. An attack that removes a limb from a body completely, a Sundered Limb is represented by completely hiding the afflicted limb from sight (tucked into clothes, covered with jacket, covered with cloth).

  "Terror": "Countered by Mind Resist. A horrific psionic attack that forces the victim to flee from the source of Terror for 5 minutes. The victim will attempt to flee from the presence of the individual if it is possible to do so regardless of safety; if they cannot, they will cower or otherwise show panic and deference behaviors.
